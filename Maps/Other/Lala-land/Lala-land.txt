LALA-LAND

Although Lala-land shares its main island with the Military Republic of Grogamuck, the Lala-landers themselves are placid and generous. They welcome the coming of the Iron Horse to help bring prosperity to their rolling plains and rounded mountains. 

Although set in an imaginary location, this is a properly playable map with winning score level determined by company value. Whether you find it amusing or not will depend on whether you share my sense of humour. If you do, you'll enjoy the placenames and find the newspaper reports hilarious. If you don't, well, you've still got a playable map...

For non-British players, one item may need explanation. The Isle of Man is a small island off the mainland about half way up on the left hand side. It's a peaceful place and a holiday resort, so the idea of its being a hotbed of terrorist activity is entirely ludicrous. The island is famous for its tailless breed of Manx cats. It has its own language (Manx - a form of Gaelic) which is not really spoken any more. Its emblem is a circular symbol formed of three legs. 

Enjoy this map in good health!
