Grosetania is a work in progress, I hope the win and lose triggers are working.
Seems like everytime I change a little something I forget to take it into
account for something else... Well play enjoy and hopefully I'll get a few
comments back to keep adjusting it.

P.S. - Map is 300x300 - It is a little sparse because I got tired of maps that 
had tons of passengers and weren't challenging... Enough - Give it a try.
