Coal Country is an industrial map. The towns and cities are generally 
small, and passenger traffic has been set to low levels. There are 
plenty of industries on the map, carefully balanced, and you will have 
to achieve success hauling freight as well as passengers and mail to 
achieve victory here in either single or multi player.

This map features a series of events, which differ from game to game, 
that provide opportunities of various kinds. You will have to play the 
map to get an idea of what I mean.

The map goals are industry oriented, and they are intended to be very 
tough. Achieving a bronze or even silver victory should be within the 
grasp of most players. The gold is tough, but highly possible. To get 
the bronze, you must haul 120 loads in a single year. To get the silver 
your company must also acquire $10,000,000 worth of industries. To get 
the gold, your industries must earn PROFIT in excess of $2,500,000 in 
a single year. There are many lucrative starting positions, and the map 
has a lot of random elements. You have 50 years to work with. Good luck.

In multiplayer, a steep goal has been set of hauling 150 or more loads 
in a single year. If no players achieve this goal within 50 years, the 
game ends and the player whose company has hauled the most loads for 
the whole game will be the winner.

Conditions: Low passenger traffic, Low running costs for steam engines.

Steel Mill Event: Steel revenue up 1/2, minor bonuses to iron and coal.
Lumber Event:     Lumber and Paper up 1/3, pulpwood production up
Dairy Event:      Milk revenue up 1/2, food revenue up 1/6
Aluminum Event:   Bauxite up 1/3, Aluminum up 1/2, Food and Goods up a bit
Department Store: Wool up 1/2, Goods up 1/5, Grain and Cattle up a bit
Auto Plant Event: Auto revenue up 2/3, tires up 1/3, steel up slightly,
                  rubber imports up 1/4, passenger traffic down 1/4

Note: Passenger traffic will be at its highest between 1903 and 1915. In 
      that time period, it will be low. All other times, VERY LOW.


I made this map completely from scratch. It represents an imaginary place.

Special thanks to Ceebee and MarshalN for helping me beta test this map.
