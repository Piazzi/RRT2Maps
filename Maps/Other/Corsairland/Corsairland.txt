Welcome to Corsairland, a world of fiesty pirates, dying empires, 
railroad megalomania, unpredictable drelbs, and annoying clowns.  
Build your rail consortium from the frigid wastes of the great 
drelbish crater to the steamy jungles of Bozolalia, where you must
take drastic action to keep your paying passengers from being 
accosted by traveling armies of annoying mimes.  Build track along 
the sheer precipices of the forbidding Olympus mountains to the 
giant volcanic crater lake at the top of the world.  Subdue the 
jungles of Equatoria and pacify the despotic emperor of the decrepit 
Cerulean Empire.  Corsairland is built for RRT2.  Send any questions 
to shipdude@flash.net and enjoy.  Best regards, Kent Powderly
