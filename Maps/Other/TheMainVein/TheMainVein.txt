It's fun to play and is educational also. The map is a great big eye-ball with tentacles (or veins) emenating from it. All 
the cities are named after things associated with blood, veins, the heart, etc. Its kinda errie. The only problem is its 
only playable in multiplayer mode. I would appreciate if you would respond by e-mail, let me know what you think. Thanks.
