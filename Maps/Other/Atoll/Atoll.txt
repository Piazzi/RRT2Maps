Full version RT2 map Atoll
The peaceful tribes of Atoll want to connect a major village on each 
of the 7 islands within ten years.  The people of anti-auto on the 
central island do not like change.  But they have their price.
Have not studied how to set the gold etc. yet.  Maybe someone else 
would enjoy doing this.  The map includes multi-span bridges and 
very narrow land masses. The computer competition seems unable 
to build anything.  Why?		From Gwizz


Other matters:

Question # !

Bought RT2 because of my interest in trains.  I believe it also  
has value as an educational tool.  I Have experimented  with 
scenarios where students can evaluate and assess Big Business 
Strategies as part of a Business Simulation program..
Developing these scenarios are time consuming.  Using Cheats
should help.  Any other suggestions would be helpful.

Question # 2

Down loaded the RT2 and RT2sc demos.   Tried to zip stack to 
home computer with full version tycoon.    Stacks always corrupt 
or lose file info.  Why?    Is there a best method for using Win Zip. 

Question # 3

Is it possible for me to change the scale on some of the cars. 
The sugar and wool cars are too large and passenger/mail too small.  

Question # 4

Does a passenger car at the end of a freight protect like a caboose?
There is no caboose on a passenger train.
