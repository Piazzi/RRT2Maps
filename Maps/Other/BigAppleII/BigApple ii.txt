Big Apple II - Apple Island

A map from PopTop Software for Railroad Tycoon II

This map was released by PopTop Software Inc. on 16th June 1999.

It is a map that they designed with the MAC in mind, but will also work with the PC Version.  Phil, at PopTop made it available as they were not going to use it anywhere else.


Apple Island. How peaceful and prosperous. That is until the corruptive forces of competition and corporate complacency invade.

The Island of Apple is bursting at the seams with industry, but they haven't got a way to get their goods to Market!

Jobs are on the line here.

Bronze - Have a company net worth of $15 million by the end of 30 years.
Silver - Have a company net worth of $30 million by the end of 30 years
Gold - Have a company net worth of $60 million and the highest company value by the end of 30 years

It's a tounge and cheek map so nothing historical.

Size 300 x 300
