Cheryls Valley

The wonderful valley in the utopian state of Cherylonia.
Land of wealth,prosperity & curvey blondes.


This map excludes Ports, Uranium, Nuclear Plant, Chemicals and Fertiliser.

It is designed for 1 player with no set end to the game. I play my games for 100 years.

A special event ensures that train safety is set to maximum to reduce the number of
breakdowns and to limit the number of crashes. Robbers are also set to zero. This
enables the player to build a massive rail network with as few distractions as possible.


I hope you like it, please let me know what you think.
I would be grateful if you leave the names as they are because they are very meaningful to myself.
