The Mines

The strip mining area has been ravaged, there isn't a whole lot left.
The cities have been taken over by the corporations, and renamed. The runs are long
but the money is good, and the payoffs are tough. Keep an eye on the Headlines, corruption 
is widespread.

This is the first of my industrial series, if it catches on I will put a lot more 
triggers in it.

Thanks
