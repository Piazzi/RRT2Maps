This is essentially the same map as High Desert, except that a few extra resources have been added that didn't seem to appear in the first version.

Added are bauxite mines which are certainly necessary to supply the aluminium plants that appear early in the game. Also added are 2 landfills to get rid of that nasty, but oh so lovely expensive waste. 

Hats off to the original designers for this fast-paced and uncluttered map.
