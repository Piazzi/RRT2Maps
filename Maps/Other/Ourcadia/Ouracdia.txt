Ourcadia - A map for Railroad Tycoon II

In the imaginary Republic of Ourcadia, in 1840, the President
allows the creation of railroad companies. Armed with your wits,
you set yourself the goal of interconnecting all the cities of
the Republic by a rail network.

Be the first to link all cities together. There is no time limit
in this fully functional scenario, starting in 1840 and offering
numerous events.

If you set the difficulty level to "Expert", this map will be real
hard. It is anyway harder than it seems.

I hope you enjoy laying tracks in Ourcadia !
