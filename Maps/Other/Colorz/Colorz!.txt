    Colorz!

This is a Map for the full version of 
Railroad Tycoon II. It depicts a ficticious
land where all the cities are named after
colors. The Territories are similarly
named after colors. The loads available
and terrain are related to the Territory 
color (i.e., Red has a lot of Mountains
and contains most of the minerals on the
map. Blue has a lot of Rivers and Ports).

You start in the Territory of White,
which has lots of Farms and Dairies,
and can buy access into other Territories.
The goals are related to the colors (i.e.,
connect Red to Black, deliver from Green 
to Brown). Many of the major cities in
the game have special bonuses associated
with them (i.e., the city of Gold gives a
15% revenue bonus to the first player to
connect to it).

It's actually a very nicely designed map.
Typically, you will build some milk runs
(pardon the pun) in White to build up cash.
Then buy your way into Blue or Green. After
some more cash build up, expand into Red, Black,
and Brown to win. Expanding into Purple or
Yellow is optional, but profitable.

Feedback is welcome.
