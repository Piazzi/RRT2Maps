To use this map copy the Mad King Edv3.map file to  your Railroad Tycoon II MAP folder on your hard drive. 

This is designed to be a long, drawn out map. My thanks to Graham Willard for advise and testing and to UK Rail Express - http://rrtii.future.easyspace.com/ - and to Slap - http://www.strategygames.net/games/RailroadTycoon2/ for having the best sites around. Oh and to Pop Top for the game itself, not to mention the wonderful add-on "The Second Century" (buy it!): http://www.poptop.com/

Other Notes : The Stock Market is either won or lost in the first half of this game. In order to win gold you have to destroy all your opponents completely, as they can start other companies once you've bought up their first. 

Playing with all eight opponents does clog up the map but, hay, that's the challenge.
Various town and territories will reward you for your connection and, King Ed is likely to stick his nose into your business any time he sees fit. Some of what he does will be helpful some, well, won't be.

A list of the requirements to get into all the territories follows. (Don't look if you'd rather be surprised.) All are based around your companies performance. You don't need all, but you do need more than you are given in order to win. Your  opponents start with different rights.
