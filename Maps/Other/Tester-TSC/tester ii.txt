The Tester II Map for Railroad Tycoon II TSC.
version 2.0

This map is used to test one engine against another.  It is not
a scenario.  Line up your engines with a few passenger cars for
a lap race along similar stretches of track.  See how much profit
each engine makes over a few years or a lifetime.  Test the engines
fitness for a specific type of track.  You may be surprised which 
engines bring in the most revenue.

The A1-S1 vs B1-T1 test.
I've tried to get both these standard difficulty runs the same.  But with
buildings and houses deforming terrain they may be slightly different.
The test I do is to run 6 cars (4-pass 2-oil/ 250 tons) to each station.
Press 'A' to see the book.  Check status page.
After 6 years subtract the profit from gross to see expenses.
Check the number of loads in the period. Good is 90.
Total tons = 90/(6 carloads per trainload) times 250 (tons per train) = 4000 tons.
Divide tons by (expenses + cost of engine).

In TSC you have to know the ecomonics not just the abilities of each engine.

Right now the world slope view (green, yellow, red numbers) doesn't seem to
run quite right as the numbers seemed to be slightly different than true slope.
(If you click the track building tool and run some track over the existing track
and not build it, that should clear the numbers to the true value.)
