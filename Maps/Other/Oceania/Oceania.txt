The world is upside down. All oceans are land
an vice versa. Try to connect Honululu to
Wellington(NZ). Not across the Pacific, but the
other way round! There are victory event in this
game. I've tested them on a smaller scale but not
against their real conditions. I hope, they work 
nevertheless...

Some geographical names may look or sound strange
to non-german users. I'm sorry, but I only have
german maps and atlases. So edit them, if you like...

That's all folks.
Have fun ;-)
