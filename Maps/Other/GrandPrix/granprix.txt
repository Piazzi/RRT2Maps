Grand Prix is a bold and creative map idea I came up with after
completing my Free Four All map. It took me about 4 evenings to 
put Grand Prix together, 1/4 of that just on event scripting.

In Grand Prix, you "race" your opponent to see who can connect 
Starting Gate territory to Finish Line territory and haul 50 
or more loads between them. However, there are 10 territories 
on each players half of the map, and you start with rights to 
only two of them. You must earn rights to each new territory 
in sequence, by meeting various map goals along the way.

Checkpoint 1 : Haul 30 loads between Starting Gate and Timber Corner.
Effect       : Rights are granted to Heartland territory.
Bonus        : $50,000 cash, and +2% Goodwill

Checkpoint 2 : Earn profits from industry of $750,000 in a single year.
Effect       : Rights are granted to Landbridge territory.
Bonus        : $100,000 cash, +3% more Goodwill, 5% faster turnarounds

Checkpoint 3 : Haul 20 loads between Landbridge and Timber Corner.
Effect       : Rights are granted to the Desert.
Bonus        : Company Overhead 10% cheaper, Car Maintenance 5% cheaper

Checkpoint 4 : Haul 40 loads FROM the Desert TO the Heartland.
Effect       : Rights are granted to the Swamp.
Bonus        : Fuel Costs 10% cheaper

Checkpoint 5 : Is a two-part goal. You must complete both to advance.
Checkpoint 5a: Achieve a company book value of $100,000,000
Checkpoint 5b: Haul 20 loads TO the Swamp from any combo of territories.
Effect       : Rights are granted to the Plateau.
Bonus        : Track Building -5%, Mtn Track -10%, Track Maintenance -10%

Checkpoint 6 : Haul 50 loads between Plateau and the Desert.
Effect       : Rights are granted to the Peaks. 
Bonus        : Traction +10%, Acceleration +5%, 2-6-0 Camelback available

Checkpoint 7 : Is a two-part goal. Can do either first, or simultaneous
Checkpoint 7a: Haul 40 loads FROM the Peaks TO the Plateau.
Bonus        : Engine Maintenance 5% cheaper
Checkpoint 7b: Haul 20 loads FROM the Peaks TO the Swamp.
Bonus        : Trains 10% safer, Turnaround another 5% faster
Effect       : Rights are granted to the Wasteland.

Checkpoint 8 : Is a two-part goal. Must do both at same time in one year.
Checkpoint 8a: Earn profits from industry of $1,500,000 in a single year.
Checkpoint 8b: Haul 150 loads in a single year.
Bonus        : Train Speed 10% faster, GP9 Diesel Locomotive available.
Effect       : Rights are granted to Finish Line territory.

Grand Prix   : Haul 50 loads between Starting Gate and Finish Line.
Effect       : Victory!


If playing in single player, the AI won't be a factor. It can make it most 
of the way, but it has no hope of completing the race. It is there just to 
keep you company as you play. So you are on your own in a one-man race against 
the clock. You have 100 years to win Bronze, 75 for Silver, 50 for Gold.

Good luck!
