Once upon a time there was a kingdom called Atlantis.

With Atlantis National Railways, I have tried not to overdo with resources, but to run the 
whole system it will take approximately 150 trains! Around the capital, "Wellington", and 
the heavy industrial center around "Bloomington", there space reserved for quardruple track 
in an attempt to separate local and long distance traffic. Again I have manipulated with 
the RRT2 locomotive rooster. Exept two smaller electric locomotives for suburban traffic 
(around " Wellington") there are only steam engines avaiable until 1956.

The scale is 10 squares=5 km
