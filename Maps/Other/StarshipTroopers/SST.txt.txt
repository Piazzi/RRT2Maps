Starship Troopers
Map for Railroad Tycoon II TSC.
version 1.0

'Bug Mr. Rico.  Zillions of them!'.
After many years of terraforming the planet Kraken V and ridding
it of the bug bests. (Basically dropping water ice asteroids on it). 
The humans have developed a good eco-system here.  
Only 10% of the water as earth and only 10% the plant life it 
neverless provides a critical supply point for the space fleet.

Some arachnids apparently have survived long hidden deep in the 
planet and have multiplied many times over. They now are trying 
to reclaim the surface.  

Your job is to supply the many military bases and forts with enough 
troops to fight the menace.  Also, you should be looking forward 
to the day you leave this place and return to earth.
Once you leave here only your own cash will matter.  
Except the Federation may not send you back to earth if you have
failed in your job of supplying the troops.

Notes:
Bug attacks destroy rail lines.  You may lose trains too if they 
are on the track or in a station.  Buying a single expensive engine 
will prove risky.  Also, double trackline outside the security area 
may prove costly.  

Suggestion:
Use non-electric diesel or steam for your exploration train.
If it survives a few years electrify and double track.

Computer players don't have much chance.  But they can be of some use.  
If a bug destroys their rails they will not rebuild them.  But, you can. 
And if you do they will use your lines and pay you.
