Other Notes : This map started as an test case for the editor and then I got carried away. You will need to play against, at least, one of the four AI's to make it work. Better yet, play on "Expert" with all four AI's supplied. It's been designed for long play so the economics move slowly. 
Oh, and watch your back. Things could get nasty.
