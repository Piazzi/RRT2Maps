COPALIS

A first map collaboration between Michael Burke & Jamie Burnett. 
Basically a 150x150 square with a large hole in the middle.  The "pit" has the larger cities 
but you have to buy the priviledge of serving them.

It's a race to see who can make the most profitable railroad, $50 Million seems profitable to
me.  This is more of a corporate greed than personal goal since you don't have to pay dividends
to win.... But do so at the risk of losing control of your railroad.
The game can hold 6 players and when you get 4 the map can get pretty congested really quick.
The designers recommend 4 players.

If you like the map comments can be emailed to 
mgburke@hotmail.com
We are currently building larger maps so your input will help us get what the players want 
into playable form.

Thanks,
Mike Burke & Jamie Burnett
