HIBIRNIA 1862 version 1:

Welcome to Hibirnia! The Goverment has signed a contract with your company to build and run a railway system over a 30 year 
period in order to build a trunkline along the coast with several secondary lines to connect to the hinterland. If you fail, 
your company will recieve a fine of 2 mill.
The main buisines is mining, logging and acriculture (along the coast).

Note:  Space is reserved for quadouble track and/or bypasses around most of the big population centres
Average distance between stations are approximately 5-10 km, using a scale of 2 squares = 1 km.

Win conditions: BRONZE: 30 mill., SILVER: 50 mill., GOLD: 75 mill. of company book value within 30 years, And Tabora (the 
capital) connected to Finatere, Sina and Elguin. NOTE: No diesels or electrics are avaiable before  before 1973. Special 
features: A couple on this map I have tried to simulate tunnels, (steep narrow and overgrown gorges). Status over CBV, PNW, 
lenght of track, (single or double), and company type load hauled.
Personally I prefer to simulate a minor railway system with pretty landscapes, without any disturbing competition or too 
many train crashes. If You agree, I recommend the following cheat: TAB. Then whrite NOWRECK to eleminate all traincrashes.
