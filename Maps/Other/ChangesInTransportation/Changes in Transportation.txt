Changes In Transportation
By Brian Duarte

The railroads main job is to compete with the canal and the roads being built in a contry. 
The default start year is 1840. You can start the map between the years of 1830 to 1850. 
The towns are spread apart and only contain housing. The industry is spread out around the 
map. All of the events, except the ones that depend on money and economic conditions, will 
happen before 1870. You can add event and change whatever you want. Feel free to change it 
and repost it.
