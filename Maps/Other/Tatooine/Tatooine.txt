Tatooine!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A map for Railroad Tycoon II (full version) ++ A. Moorer (ver1.0 1/99)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iron horses in the deserts of Tatooine, the arid homeworld of smugglers,
jawas and the occasional jedi wannabe...

This scenario is designed for single play against computer opponents. 
I put this together fairly quickly, so I haven't made provisions for
multiple players. If I receive enough requests I'm willing to take this
map to a version 2.0, so feel free to send an email to me with feedback.

The land area is wide but quite navigable and resources are for the
most part concentrated around the relatively few population centers.
Rails may need to reach long distances for resources.

Population growth is rising, due to the Emperor's recent policy of 
forcing troublemakers on more populated planets into exile on Tatooine.
However, a severe lack of resources and usuable land hinders industrial 
development.

As I was making this scenario I attempted to locate any official SWars
maps in hopes of being as faithful to that universe as possible.
Unfortunately, the closest I got was a reference to a map which was
printed on the box-backs of a few early toys. My apologies for any
deviations from the established world-fiction. Any diehard fans who
have information or suggestions to improve the map, let me know.
