This map is different I know but I've enjoyed playing it alot.
Designed it to be played at expert levels and no modifiers for
computer or you!!  I got tired of seeing the same combo's of
industry and starting in early 1830's so anyway this has some 
interesting events and tested win scenario's.

Gold = 50Mil in Company Book value and 1 mil in Industry profits
       in a year by 1985.

Silver = 40Mil Co. Book Value and 1mil Industry profits in a year
         by 1986.

Bronze = 30Mil Co. Book Value and 1mil Industry Profits in a year
         by 1987.
