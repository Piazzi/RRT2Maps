NEW EDEN

New Eden is a place I once dreamt of: a great cupola under which life is calm 
and there's a lot of time to devote to ourselves. I thought it was a good idea to
make it become a map for Railroad Tycoon II.


NEW EDEN MAP: HISTORY AND HINTS

It's 1950: a green light lands in Sahara desert, in Africa. A group of aliens founds New Eden:
a great cupola made of glass in which earthlings can just enter, but they can't get out.
So people inside grow. They're all happy and calm in this paradise, but New Eden can
survive only if you bring the chemical and uranium cargos, coming from the space, that land on the waters of Hyper 
Sea to the Geocore plant and to the nuclear plants placed in the centre of the cupola.

The aim of this map is to haul as many chemical and uranium cargos as possible from Hyper 
Sea to New Eden Geocore. Without these cargos New Eden can't survive!

Follow the instructions that appear in the dialogs and on the newspapers.

Hint: use electric engines so that you can exploit aliens technologies and devices to improve
 acceleration, traction and speed of the engines.

The game has been tested by myself: I've been able to haul more than 500 uranium and chemical
cargos within 2000. So I fixed the gold medal condition to 500 cargos.

If you find some difficulty or problem in New Eden map, please write me.

Enjoy New Eden map!
