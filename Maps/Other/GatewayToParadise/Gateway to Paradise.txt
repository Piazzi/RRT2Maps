Gateway to Paradise

This map is a stand-alone scenario. I designed it originally with only the portion 
labeled ‘Paradise’ as a way to teach myself how to manage high volumes of traffic. 
This map was made on a Pentium II PC with RTII, TSC as the game program. If 
you are concerned with your computer’s ability to handle the event load, then you 
may wish to try ‘Paradise Light’ which is less computationally intensive.

There are a variety of fictional territories on the map. The terrain is fairly gentle 
and rolling. The challenge comes from the events. None of the territories really 
care to be connected to each other. Of course, that is what it takes to win. You will 
have to build at least two spanning bridges. Access to Paradise is not allowed 
until ten years after the start of the game. 

The technique I have used to win the game is as follows. The human player starts 
a new company for each territory. When he or she finishes with a territory, the 
player sets the company to maximum dividends. All of the companies after the 
first are wholly human owned. When all of the territories are filled and 
connected, start merging the companies together. There are other ways to win.

Jerry Meyer was of great help in designing this map.
