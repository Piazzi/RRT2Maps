Hello!
Here I am again, "The Arctic Duck", with a new RRT2 map. By making this map I`ve tried to 
manipulate with the locomotives, so they get faster and more powerful, following the 
tecnological develoment from 1856 till now. It means, for instance,that even a more 
powerful Consolidation (first build in 1877) could be useful for smaller jobs until 
the end of steam! In fact, I have made it possible to go by steam all through the game! 
Also I have made an attempt to eleminate many of those silly train crashes, which too 
often occurs in the original RRT.
