ARBORIA 1862 version 1:

Welcome to Arboria! The Goverment has signed a contract with your company to build and run a railway system over a 30 year 
period. If you fail, your company will recieve a fine of 2 mill.
The main buisines is mining and logging industry.

By  drawing this map I have built all railway lines with a maximum gradient of 2%, and replaced them with reserve cells. 
When finished the map I have liqudated the company and then tested the game by playing it 2 times.   
Personally I prefer to simulate a minor railway system with pretty landscapes, without any disturbing competition or too 
many train crashes. If You agree, I recommend the following cheat: TAB. Then whrite NOWRECK to eleminate all traincrashes.  

This map has been drawn by Anders Robert Pilgaard - Århus - Denmark.  (bx03638@post7.teledk).
