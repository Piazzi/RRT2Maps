Comments:

Liberal use of territories & some events which dramatically affect game play.  Game spans from 1900 to 2020 (I guess three generations of a family business?).

Objective is to have personal net worth of $200 million by 2020.  It is do-able with the revenue multiplier set to zero.  It is too easy with it set above zero.

There is a lot of cargo out there but the most valuable stuff is expensive to get to.

Hints:

Be willing & ready to shift your strategy in mid-game -- from short hauls to long; from passenger to cargo.

Carefully pick & choose which territories you want to buy access to.

Have fun!!!
