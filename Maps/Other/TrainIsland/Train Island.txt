Train Island
============

Please note that this is a fictional map. If you do not like the
engines in this map then I suggest pressing TAB and then typing in
'show me the trains' to get all trains.

This is a rather small map and is created from scratch. It does not
have many events and there are only three engines available:

-Electric GG1
-Class 1020
-Pennsylvania E44

I hope you will enjoy playing this scenario! :)
