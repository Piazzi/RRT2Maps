The Tester Map for Railroad Tycoon II.
version 1.0

This map is used to test one engine against another.  It is not
a scenario.  Line up your engines with a few passenger cars for
a lap race along similar stretches of track.  See how much profit
each engine makes over a few years or a lifetime.  Test the engines
fitness for a specific type of track.  You may be surprised which 
engines bring in the most revenue.
