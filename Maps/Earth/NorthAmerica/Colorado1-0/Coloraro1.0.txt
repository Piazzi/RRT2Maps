Colorado1.0 map/scenario for Railroad Tycoon II

This is the release version of my Colorado map it contains a victory condition and several 
events.

If you wish to comment on it send e-mail to sanderso@rectec.net

I worked on this map for many hours. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it.

I may update it in the future if ther is a demand for it.
