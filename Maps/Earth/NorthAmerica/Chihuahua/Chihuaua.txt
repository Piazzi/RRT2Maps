Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad

This amazing railroad was conceived as a shortcut for exporting goods to the Orient from the central US. The original route 
started in Wichita, Kansas and ended at the seaports near Los Mochis. It took almost 90 years to build, 90 million dollars 
and there are almost 90 tunnels. The first trains ran the route in 1961. This is some of the most spectacular and difficult 
terrain in the rail world. The switchbacks are a poor substitute for the bridges and tunnels, but you will get the idea of 
how hard it was to lay this rail.

Today the route between Chihuahua and Los Mochis still operates for passenger service. Your task in this scenario is to 
complete this 400 mile route and run 12 or more loads of any cargo or passengers over it. You have 30 years to do it for 
Gold, 50 for Silver, and 80 for Bronze. Also, you need a compnay book value of 20 million or more for the Gold.

For each year you are able to supply  4 loads or more of OIL to "Petroleo Fabricante" you will cut your deisel fuel bill in 
half. For each year you are able to supply 4 or more loads of  COAL  to "Compania Electrico" you will cut your electric bill 
in half.

If you find yourself looking far and wide for cargoes and are having a hard time making ends meet, you will get and an 
accurate impression of what it is like to operate a railroad in Mexico. The west side of the Sierras has good agriculture, 
especially sugar and produce. There is some cattle in the SE around Durango, and the mountains are abundant in mining and 
minerals. Passengers wont pay much so look elsewhere to turn a profit.

To win multiplayer, connect los Mochis and Chihuahua and haul 12 loads. First one wins, no time limit.
