The California Map for Railroad Tycoon II.
version 1.05
The Golden State welcomes your railroad.
See if you can win the gold medal.
Beware though there is an earthquake event that can
take your trains right off the tracks.

The actual ground scale is about 3 miles per
cell. (not the 10 as in RRT2)
To relate on a smaller scale things like 
track building, maintenance are decreased 
by 50%.  (It may take some teaking to get
all the scaling right so there could be
more versions coming.)
ver.
  .01 Added ecomonic downturn after quake
  .02 Long Beach fixed.  Corrected spelling
  .03 researched a little more.
      also no customs between states.
  .04 The Gold and Silver were a little too high.
      Lowered them.
  .05 New References result in small changes in
      resource locations.
