This map of Minnesota is fairly accurate in terms of 
locations, natural resources, and industries.  For added
interested I've includeded some events and news articles
about Minnesota history and lore such as Minnesota's 
role in the Civil War.  Some of these events are 
related to railroads.  Helpful comments are welcomed.
