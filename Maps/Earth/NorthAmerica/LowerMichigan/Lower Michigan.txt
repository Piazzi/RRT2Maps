--- Map Description --
	Can you provide for the automobile industry in southeast Michigan and the furniture industry in northern 
and western Michigan?  Can you be the first to connect the two major cities of Chicago and Detroit?
	My philosophy while building this map was to use small villages to place industry.  Rarely do you see 
industry without at least a small town around it.  The nice little side benefit is that your home town is more likely to 
be present.  This map file is bigger than most because of this, but I think you will like what I have created.
