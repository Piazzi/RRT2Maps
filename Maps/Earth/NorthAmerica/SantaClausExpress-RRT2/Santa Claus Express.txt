Railroad Tycoon II

Map Title: Santa Claus Express
Version: 1.1  (Dec. 26/99)

Changes in Version 1.1:
1. Fixed silver victory conditions for Thunder Bay and Vancouver.

This map can be played in all versions of RRT2.  

This is a Christmas map that I thought would be fun for the
holidays.  The map is based in Canada only, but where else would
the North Pole be but in Canada? (Magnetic north pole anyway.)
Besides, that's where I live and am familiar with.

The map is based on the Canada map, map 6 in the original RRT2
campaign, with numerous changes to make it closer to the real city
and territory locations.  Also, three railways of Canada, CN, CP and
BC Rail have been placed as close as possible to the actual 
locations as I could within the limits of scale. 

Special notes:  
1. Although the goals state that goods must be hauled,
RRT2 has no way to check for this so you can "cheat" and haul
passengers and mail also.  The TSC version will check however.
2. I made all industries generated by the game to avoid the 
potential oversupply bug (even though I don't seem to get it).  
There may be a very slim chance that you don't get a port at the
North Pole.  If so just restart again.  I would like to know if
this happens so send an email if it does.
3. The AI seems to use a huge amount of resources, so if the games
pauses once in a while, just be patient.  I tried to design the
events as efficiently as possible.

This is my first complete map for others to use so all
suggestions are welcome.
