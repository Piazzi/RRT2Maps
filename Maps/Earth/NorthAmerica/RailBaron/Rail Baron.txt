Rail Baron
Map for Railroad Tycoon II TSC.
version 1.2

Realistically by the 1920s you would not find many cities
that were not connected by viable railroads.  So you
must compete on an unfair footing with estabished companies.
You are given a chance to open your own railroad line or
invest in stocks.  


The major step is to become CEO of one of the existing RRs.
When this is done the final goal is much easier.
It is possible to win. I won silver in under 10 years by
taking control (on considerable margin) of Penn RR.  It was
a matter of time before I win gold.

If you find errors in spelling or events let me know
so I can fix them.

Hint:  Play the game several times but watch which railroads
come out of the gate fast.  And which are slow but powerful
giants.  I invested in a fast starter and took over a slow
giant for my win.

---------------
 1.1  Added better track crossings to busy intersections.  Now
      trains can pass through each other.
 1.2  Changed the goals.  Some error in the flags.
