	its a good map that is,this vertion(3rd)is.
	ive added lotts of events,one of wich makes all revenue drop all all expenses double,usually the 
	computer companies sale all of there stock:)?i, of course, buy all the stock:)?so you may want del 
	that event(if not more of them).ive yet to beat this map,i keep restarting when 1950 rolls around
	(trying for the gold).im not even sure if it can be done on a modified expert(difficulty 100%).
	you also may want to give to computer players more money,it seems to me they take along time 
	to make any further aggresive moves(other than the stock market)after the initial one.
	i encourage you to run this with all of the events in it,it makes the game more interesting to me.

	enjoy

	i spent alot of time making a test map,really only the events,
	to look at all of the managers and write 
	their special abillities down.its in windows word 6.0 in case it looks garbled to you.
