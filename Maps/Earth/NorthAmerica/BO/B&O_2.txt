This map takes over where the first campaign game leaves off.
You more or less have the choice of recreating the Pennsylvania
or the Baltimore and Ohio. I've tried to make a slightly historical 
east coast scenario by forcing you to build east/west rather than 
north/south. There's big money to be made hauling products from the
midwest to the east coast.

I've also tried to have a mix of terrain, although it matters
much more if you chose a late start year and have a choice of
locomotives. It's an easy map on which to win bronze but 
difficult to win gold, especially starting in 1833 as train 
speeds are so pathetic. 

This is really a single person game. I haven't tried to put in 
multiplayer victory conditions. The Civil War events aren't all 
I hoped for; maybe someday I'll get around to improving them.
