The Alaska Map for Railroad Tycoon II.
version 1.03
The Alaska map is very difficult.  The starting
investment money is double that of most scenarios.

In single player try either Anchorage or Juneau.  

Note - The game does not support Choice Dialog 
options in multiplayer mode. 

1.01  Choice for single player only.
1.02  Better placement of reserve cells and industries.
1.03 New References result in small changes in
      resource locations.
