FROM NEW YORK TO BOSTON 1841 version 1:

Welcome to New England! 
The Northeastern part of the United States is a very dense populated area from New York to Boston. The railroad came early 
to this area (1841 between Boston and Providence), and soon after a huge network was built, especially in Massa-chusetts. 
Railroad history tells about famous trains as Yankee Clipper, Merchants Limited and The Colonial.
I sugest the player to start with a railroad from Boston to Providence.  After a few years to consolidate your company, you 
can start building the  trunk line to New York. In 1890 or so, the whole system should be built, and by this time it will 
take approximately 150 trains to run it. Note:: From 1950 no  steam locomotives are avaiable.

By drawing this map I have built all railway lines with a maximum gradient of 2,5%, and replaced them with reserve cells. 
When finished the map I have liqudated the company and then tested the game by playing it 2 times.
Personally I prefer to simulate a minor railway system with pretty landscapes, without any disturbing competition or too 
many train crashes. If You agree, I recommend the following cheat: TAB. Then whrite NOWRECK to eleminate all traincrashes. 
NEW!!! I have made a couple of gorges so narrow, that they, when overgrown with trees, looks exactly like tunnels.
