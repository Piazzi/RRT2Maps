SCENARIO NOTES: Canada 1890

The premise is that the Canadian Pacific Railway never succeeded 
in building the transcontinental link.  The human player begins
in the west, but faces competition from railroads in both eastern
Canada and the central United States.

I've tried to inject a sense of history into this scenario.  Look
for Gold Rushes, the Prairie Wheat Boom, and World War One as
significant events.


VICTORY CONDITIONS:
===================
The human player must gain at least four "victory points by the
end of 1925.
     Gold - Six points
     Silver - Five points
     Bronze - Four points

One point is earned for the each of the following.
     Having the highest net-income during 1925
     Having the highest book value during 1925
     Completing each of the four missions.


MAP CHANGES:
============
This scenario uses a modified version of the Canada map which is
included in the game.  Some sections of the map were not assigned 
to provinces, and were considered "Canadian" territory.  These 
sections have been assigned to the correct territories.

Ports produce small quantities of food.  This is an attempt to
introduce fish as a resource.  On the west coast, this would be 
canned salmon and on the east coast, canned tuna.

Several villages have been added to British Columbia and the Yukon
Territory.  These are intended merely to flesh out the province
and they have little impact on game play.

The town of Nelson is featured in the (1982?) movie "Roxanne" (Steve
Martin, Daryl Hannah).  This town is EXACTLY as shown in the movie.
Fly in from Vancouver, then rent a car and drive back to Vancouver
through Kelowna and other points of interest.


GOLD RUSHES:
============
Gold rushes are designed to distract and amuse the human player
during the first few years of the game.  After 1900, gold rushes
end and the player begins focusing on missions.  Expected net
return (EV) is calculated for each gold rush, since outcomes
are determined at random.  Carmacks gets a little more complex.

 MacKenzie Gold Rush - Player may invest $20,000 with a 90% chance
  of receiving $100,000 within the next year.  EV = $90,000

 Atlin Gold Rush - Company may invest $50,000 plus track and station
  costs with a 50% chance of a $1,000,000 payoff.  This section of
  track may also be helpful in completing the Carmacks Gold Rush.
  EV = $250,000 (estimated net of costs)

 Dawson Gold Rush - Player may invest $50,000 with a 25% chance
  of receiving $500,000 within the next year.  EV = $125,000

 Carmacks Gold Rush - Company may build route with variable costs
  in excess of construction possible.

   50% $250,000
   25% $100,000
       $500,000 estimated construction costs

   High Road (Pay upgrades)     Low Road (Don't pay upgrades)
   10% $6,000,000 payoff
   23% $2,000,000 payoff        25% $2,000,000 payoff
   17% $1,000,000 payoff        25% $1,000,000 payoff

   Exp costs:  $  650,000       $  500,000
   Exp payoff: $1,218,750       $  687,500
   Exp profit: $  568,750       $  187,500
