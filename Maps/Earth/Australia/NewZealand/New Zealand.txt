Map: New Zealand
Version: 1.0
Creator: Veit Irtenkauf

Welcome to New Zealand, one of the most beautiful countries on this planet!  I hope you
will enjoy this map -- please provide me with feedback, esp. with suggestions -- I'm
still learning!


Please copy this map into the MAPS folder in your RRT2 directory


This map is a pretty accurate map of New Zealand, with the geography and topography modeled
as closely to the original as possible.  I also tried to place the right industries into the
right regions.

Tips
----
You will find that it is very costly to lay track in this map.  Try to find flat parts
and get your basic industries running before crossing the mountains and hauling freight
over long distances.


Upcoming releases
-----------------
Currently, you can go whereever you want -- there are no borders.  I'm currently working
on a version with borders where you have to buy your ways into various territories.
Starting your railroad in the right place will be more important than ever.
