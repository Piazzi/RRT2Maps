; Language file for Railroad Tycoon II - The Second Century
; Altered by Steve Martineau for Cam Hills' Tasmania scenario
;
; if you use the parameter /D2, as in
; RT2.EXE /D2
; the game will validate this file on input and print any errors to a file
; called language.log.  This is strongly encouraged
;
;
; All characters, including all the vowels with umlauts, graves, and other
; accents, should be supported
;
; All strings should begin and end with a quote "
; You may not use the following types of brackets []{}
; in the text, as they are used internally by the game for other purposes
;
; \n is a carriage return
;
; DON'T CHANGE ANY OF THE NUMBERS.  They're used by the program
; to match up strings.  That way, more strings can be added later, and 
; foreign language versions can be easily updated
;
;
; semicolons at the start of a line are comments, these
; lines won't be processed 
;
; This file does not currently have some of the strings used in scenarios
; specifically, city names, events, and scenario descriptions.
;
; I haven't decided yet whether to export that text to an outside file
; for editing, or have translators use the game editor itself to modify that
; text (It's all accessible from within the editor.)
; Please don't try to modify that text until a decision has been made on
; this issue.
;  
; Some lines are empty, containing only a double quote "" 
; Those are placeholders, ignore them.
;
; When you see %1, %2 etc, another string will be copied in there.  You can
; change the order if you like, just make sure you don't delete any of these
;
; 
; The primary windows upon which longer text blurbs are displayed
; (such as the window with the eagle at the top) are dynamically resizable
; and will accomodate longer or shorter text easily.  Text meant to go on
; buttons will of course be very restricted in length.  
;
; There should be no place in the game where putting a longer piece of 
; text will cause it to crash.  However, in many instance a longer piece of
; text will be cut off on screen.
;
; To see the available space on screen into which a given piece of text must
; fit, change the game from full screen to windowed mode.  You must have 
; Win 95 in 1152 x 878 resolution or higher, then you can press <F4>
; On the menu bar at the top, select 'Debug', then 'Show Text Rectangles'
; You should see purple rectangles around all the text on the screen.
;
;
;
;
; Here's the text... translate away!

You can rotate or zoom the map using the buttons at the bottom right.\n\nWhen you're ready to start your railroad, double click <Start a New Company> in the listbox at the center bottom of the screen."

As you're dragging, you'll see numbers indicating the track laying cost for a particular square and the grade (steepness) of that section.  (Try to keep grades below 2%)."

2427    "Building your station is only the start, you'll probably want to build a few supporting buildings for your station, to service your trains and improve their efficiency.\n\nFor starters, we strongly recommend a water tower, sanding tower, and roundhouse in your principal station.  (You probably don't need them in every station.)\n\nClick <Buy>, then build each of the buildings.\n\nWhen you're done, press <EXIT> to go back to the main screen, then place your second station."
2428    "Alright, you've got your track and stations - the last critical element is trains, of course.  Click on the train button at left, then buy a train."
2429    "Use this screen to set up and control your trains.\n\nWith only two stations, routing is pretty simple, but as you add stations, you'll need to pick and choose where each train goes by dragging the stations from the map on the right to the route list on the left.\n\nYou'll also need to choose which cargos to haul.  Click on the switch at the upper right to change to cargo mode, then click appropriate cargos, based on which cargos the station has available (as shown at the bottom of the screen)."

;2431    "The stock market - useful in turning large fortunes into small ones.\n\nAt the 'Easy' difficulty setting, you'll only be able to buy and sell stock in your own company.  Since you probably used all your personal money to start your company, you won't have much to worry about on the easy setting.\n\nLater, you can play at a higher difficulty level and invest in your competitors, short sell their stock, buy on margin, and generally have fun as only the Wall Street boys know how."
2432    "Company Detail\n\nUse this screen to monitor the fortunes of your company and your competitors.\n\nA couple key features - in the Overview section you can change the company manager (your underling), opting for a different set of skills, and perhaps a different price tag.\n\nIn the finances section, you can issue stock and bonds and generally control financing inflows and outgoes."
2433    "Player Detail\n\nOK, so 19th century railroad barons aren't exactly a handsome bunch - it's not looks that count here, it's money.\n\nYou can use this screen to check out your competition (if any), and your own biography.\n\nTo view other players, click on the left and right arrows on the lower right side of the screen."

;2435    "Back for more?\n\nIf you're ready for a bit more challenge, start a new game with a difficulty of Medium, or even Hard, and throw a few computer players into the mix.\n\nSome of the more advanced financial and industrial aspects of the game aren't enabled unless you have difficulty set to 'Hard', or you choose <Options> and select the expert financial and industrial models.\n\nConversely, if all you want to do is goof around, try <Options> - <Sandbox Mode>."
2436    "In sandbox mode, you're not playing for money, or competing in any way.  Just build and enjoy.\n\nYou also get some new tools to play with.  Try them out - they're the same tools used to create new maps in the map editor."
2437    "With the industrial model set to advanced or expert, the different industries are much more important.\n\nIn order to get full value for your cargos, you need to haul them to a station where they're demanded.\n\nFor example, haul grain to any station which has a nearby bakery.\n\nThe bakery will pay a premium for the grain, then convert it to food, which can be hauled to any city for a nice profit.\n\nYou can click on any building on the map to find out what it supplies and demands."
2438    "The editor allows you modify the game maps or create your own.\n\nIn this demo version, you cannot save maps, so you can only play around in the editor.
