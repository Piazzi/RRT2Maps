General:
The aim in this scenario is to transport sugar-beets on a small, privately owned railway in rural Lower-Saxony during harvesting time in 1985.

Restrictions:
In this scenario, time is counted by days, not years.
Only a limited number of certain loads is available at some stations.
Tracks and engines cannot be built/bought; you have to work with what you get in the beginning. Engines can crash.
You may not go to the stock-market, but your shareholders can fire you. Make use of managers to keep your companies finances sound.

Players:
Single player only.

Timeframe:
September 15 through 30 (1985)

Victory conditions:
BRONZE:	Transport 60 loads of sugar to Eystrup by the end of September 30.
SILBER:	Transport 70 loads of sugar to Eystrup by the end of September 30.

	also, transport 4 loads of goods to Bruchhausen-Vilsen and Hoya.

Remarks:
You can find some remarks on the background of this scenario in the "briefing".
For a strategy, remember that people in the countryside help each other, even if that does not pay off immediately.
