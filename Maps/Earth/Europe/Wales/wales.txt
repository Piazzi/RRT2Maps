This is my first map I have made for Railroad Tycoon 2.
It's a map of one of my favoured places..Wales.

Features:

- City regions, with separate access right and track lay rights
- Silver and Gold to win
- Three National Park regions
- Future train technology to gain earlier in the game..if you play it right!

I will continue to update this map.

I hope you enjoy this one.
