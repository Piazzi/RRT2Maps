I live in Staufen and there I visit the local school. I made this map with the help of my memory, the school atlas and a touristic map. It took some time to create this, and this is my first scenario. So I hope there are not too many mistakes and that this scenario is fun. 
Notes:
-There are no instructions. Just have fun.
-Staufen has got a population about 9000.
-The size of the area is in reality about 35km x 35km
-France doesn't play any role. You even can't access it.
-This is no big map. Just the area I live in, but it was quite hard to create it.
