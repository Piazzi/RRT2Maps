This scenario is my first attempt. Hopefully interesting to
RRTII players outside Denmark too. Consider the possibility
of shipping out Carlsberg Beer from Copenhagen, symbolized by
the food cars shipping out of Copenhagen's cannery. The small
geographic changes to the map, are intentional. Otherwise it 
would not be possible to link Sweden to Germany, as will be a
reality in the year 2000.
