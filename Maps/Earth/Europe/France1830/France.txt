To make this Scenario we took a long time, as we wanted to create a whole new France, different
from the map you find in the game.
Initially we got the map from an Encyclopedia, then we transformed it into a grey scale image, 
with 5 tones of grey; Spain, Italy and Germany weren't on the map, so we had to invent them by 
getting the indications from an atlas. We also tried to follow the real geographic features and 
the distribution of the resources. There are the industrial area of the Rühr, the farm area in 
the Vallée de la Loire, the woods are in the Alpes and in the Pirenées and the mines are in the 
Massif Central and in the Rühr.

The scenario has also some elements of real history: the "Carlist" war in the Spanish Peninsula 
will forbid building in Spain for six years; the 1948 revolution  will create problems in the 
goodwill rate and so on.
There are also some easter eggs, but we are not going to tell you. You surely are clever enough 
to find them in the editor....

This scenario has victory conditions: 
Start: 1830
Gold - Connect Marseille to Köln before 1850
Silver - The same within 1860
Bronze - The same within 1870

We can tell you that the gold is really difficult to get if you set the game on the top levels 
of difficulty.
We hope you will enjoy playing this scenario; the next one should cover Central Italy (we are 
Romans)

This Scenario is FREE, don't pay who wants to sell it to you.
