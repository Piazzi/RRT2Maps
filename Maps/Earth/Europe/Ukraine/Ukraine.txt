Part 2
Feel free to build a railroad-system in East Poland, East Rumania and Ukraine. It is an open end game with 
no newspapers and no tasks. Notice, that a lot of cities has old names (different from modern names).

Like in all my maps, industries and woods are on the right place. Surely, not all industries worked on the 
same times Ð but I mean, that is no problem for a game!
