Map: a map with lots of sugar, and other food. The cities are heavily filled with bakeries and other factories.


area: 

  This is a map of my home Island, Lolland, and it's sister island, Falster, also known as the sugar isles. 

  In real life, I think the measures are something like: 150*80 km. But this is only a guess. I have stuffed so many factories into the cities, since even a little bakery counts, when we are talkin maps of these real size!

  The economic situation of the isles at present isn't good at all, taken in consideration, that it is in Denmark. But I haven't got that into the game, since a good railway can do a lot to the economy itself!
