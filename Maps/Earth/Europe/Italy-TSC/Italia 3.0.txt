Dear fans of Italy.map,

since "The Second Century" Expansion Pack allows new engines, new buildings and new wagons,
we have updated the map of Italy in order to use all of these items.
You may develop railway lines starting from 1839 and go on until you want. 
New events have been added, like facilities for connecting Italy to Africa or the eruption of the volcano Vesuvio.
Enjoy Italy.map and ... don't forget to send us your remarks. (Thanks to your messages we have improved again Italy's landscape)

Bye,
