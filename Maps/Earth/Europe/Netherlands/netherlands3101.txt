Netherlands version 2.0
The map of the Netherlands is a real map taken from a atlas.
I made some changes of the land and industry also the city's are now really correct.
I am working further with this map so any reaction, MAIL ME at.

note
some people mail me but i cant mail them back because i had a system crash.
so when i put back my backup all the email accounts are gone.
so keep me in touch for those who mailt me.
