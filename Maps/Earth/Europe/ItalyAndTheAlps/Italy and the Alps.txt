
 Italy and the Alps    (TSC) 
 -----------------------

Northern Italy is the most industrialised and prosperous part of the country.  This scenario covers the western half of this area and is almost completely ringed by mountain ranges of which the Alps dominate.  The neighbouring countries are France and Switzerland with Germany beyond.  Several rail tunnels were cut though the mountains to facilitate trade - Frejus, Simplon and Saint Gotthard.   Since they were bored there has been a plethora of tunnel building for road traffic. 

Agriculture varies a good deal and we have tried to be retain the flavour of the various regions.  
Produce = fruit or grapes.  
Distilleries = wine producers.  
Mineral resources are rare or were worked out so you will have to establish trade routes.  Many Italian industries appear by name, some well known like Fiat and Pirelli, others less well known but no less important.  

CHALLENGE 
The basic challenge concerns trade routes across the region, to the major port of Genoa and the three Alpine tunnels.  You will also have to buck the trend and build a new trans-Alpine route without a tunnel.  Many valleys lead into the Alps and the choice will be yours.    

DESIGN NOTES
This being an English-speaking site we have used well known Anglicised versions of some of the place names in the text but the map remains faithful to the Italian names.  For example, Turin = Torino, Milan = Milano, Genoa = Genova.   
Credit goes to Marco Steffanutti who generated the first map some years ago.  We have redrawn it and written a gameplay but Marco deserves credit for starting the ball rolling.
