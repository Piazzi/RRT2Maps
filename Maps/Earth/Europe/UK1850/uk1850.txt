Notes for UK1850 Version 1.3


This map is an altered version of the Britain map, adjusted mainly for local knowledge.

Several things should be pointed out:

Building costs begin much higher than normal to reflect high land costs.

Borrowing will be difficult to start with as railways are still a new thing.

Because railways in Britain use good use of viaducts and cuts to level rail gradients, traction is better. This also contributes to the costs above.

Victory conditions.
A map without these is like kissing your sister: it don't count.
However they are "blind". To find out how to win you must carefully read the clues in the game, such as newspaper events and rumours.
Basically you need to gain the respect of the Royals and the Government.

Have fun
