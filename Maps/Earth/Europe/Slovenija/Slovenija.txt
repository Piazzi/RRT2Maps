Alesso - Udine - Italy - July 2000

On the 25th of April I went to Slovenija. 
I haven't been there since 1983 and quite to my surprise I found out tidy and clean 
villages, towns and cities: it wasn't the same when Slovenija wasn't independent!!!
Since Slovenija became independent new freeways and roads have been built, but railways are still
very backward: for example the fastest train from Trieste to Lubljana (100 km) takes about 3 hours!
By car: 1 hour; by bycicle, maybe 3-4 hours.
In fact there are lots of stretches of railroad where the maximum speed is set to 50-60 km/h.
In this scenario, starting in the year in which Slovenija became free from Jugoslavia, you find no railway when you start. 
You have to rebuild Slovenija railway system, so that modern fast trains can haul as many cargos as possible between Slovenija
and Western Europe countries, that is Italy and Österreich.

The map has been tested by myself using the "hard" level of difficulty.

Enjoy this map, have fun,
