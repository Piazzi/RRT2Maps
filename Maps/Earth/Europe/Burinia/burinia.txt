Burinia is an historical region around Roma. The inhabitants are frendly and hearty, but 
they are worried for the arrival of millions of pilgrims in Roma for the 2000 Jubilee.
Roads are full of work yards, traffic is blocked, people curse.
You have an important mission: build an efficient and capable railway system, otherwise 
the wrath of God is going to fall down on the Eternal City.
However this game goes, we suggest you to eat some Ariccia's roast pig and drink some 
Castles wine!

Have fun playing on Burinia map.
