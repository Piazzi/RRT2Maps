                        Norwegian railroadhistory- made fore The secound century(the expansion pack)only.


This is a single map/champaign, and it is a reconstruction of the Norwegian railroad(NSB). Part 1 its the 
southern part of Norway(1853-1950). You have to build up the railroad step by step, as it was done
in the old days.You will recive new orders each time a "real" connection has been made. 
Part two its the middle part of Norway(Northern railroad (1921-1962). You have to build the northern railroad, step
by step in the same way you did with the southern part. Part three(1963-2014) its the northern part of Norway.
This part was planned, but the gouverment canceleted it, because it was 
of leak of money, and the because of the population in the area. So the track was never build... 
And the challange to you its to complete their old plan, and make the peouple happy!
The last map, world war three leads you throw a new world war. The atmosphere its destroyed, so you have to fight against the
water, and the enemy. Its a hard map to beat. You will lose trains before you even nows about it, and 
if you failure to deliver the limit chargo one year, the water will raise! I have added a complete new history into that map.
So its up to you now, to manage that the human rase will survive.
 
I have made all the maps difficult to win. But it is a rank anyway:
Part one its the easiest map to win. Map to difficult, and map three and four its allmost impossible to win.
But they are all difficult maps, so you have much to do in the future.
Many historic happenings has been adden, and many challenge to.
