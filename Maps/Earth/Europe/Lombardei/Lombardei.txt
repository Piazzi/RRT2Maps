Lombardei/Lombardia


Lombardia is a beautiful country in Italy. Old cities, good food, a beautiful countryside Ð and high technology, 
industies (ugly, very sad to see). Build a railway network. There's no scenario.


Have fun,

P.S. As in all my maps I made all the industries and resources are based on real economic data.
