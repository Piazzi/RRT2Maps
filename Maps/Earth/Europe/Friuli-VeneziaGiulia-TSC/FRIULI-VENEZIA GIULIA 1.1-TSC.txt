FRIULI-VENEZIA-GIULIA.MAP

This map represents the North-East part of Italy, including a part
of the bordering countries. It's a very detailed map, more than Italy.map,
of which we are authors.

There are lots of cities and lots of valleys to explore. Events lead
you through the history of this land where boundaries very often moved.
In this map what was missing in Italy.map has been added: a sequence of chapters
that define the victory conditions.

We suggest you to be alone in this scenario, so that you may create historical railways
without interferences. Prepare a notebook next to you and write down
the conditions to gain victory when the dialogs appear.

If you reach 4 of the 6 goals, you'll have the broze medal; 5/6 will give you the 
silver medal, 6/6 the gold medal. These chapters are distributed in time from 1840 to 2020.
In the beginning you'll be left free enough to construct some profitable line; then you'll have
to connect Trieste to Villa Opicina, Udine to Villach, Udine to Gorizia and to Trieste; 
you'll have to re-organize your company, develop electric lines to reduce pollution and finally, 
extabilish a corridor between Italy and Austria towards East Europe and haul lots of cargos.
In these events the attention is put in historical lines and in your railway network management.

We wait for your questions and your remarks to make this map one of the best ones ever made in the
world!

P.S. Friuli is the region where we come from. You can find even our village on this map! 
P.S. There are two versions of this map:

	FRIULI-VENEZIA-GIULIA-1-RT2 (for RT2 classic)
	FRIULI-VENEZIA-GIULIA-1-TSC (for TSC)

The TSC version can be played with the new engines and cargos: keep in mind that in Friuli
there are lots of distilleries and of barracks!

15/8/99	

	FRIULI-VENEZIA-GIULIA-1.1-RT2 (for RT2 classic)
	FRIULI-VENEZIA-GIULIA-1.1-TSC (for TSC)

The victory conditions of the single chapters have been balanced: after a deepened test some of the 6 goals seemed
to be too easy or too difficult to reach. Some little landscape adjustments have been made too.

Enjoy Friuli.map and... wait for our future maps... Switzerland and Burinia....
Who knows when they will be ready!
