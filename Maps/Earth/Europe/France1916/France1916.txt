SCENARIO NOTES: France 1916 (v 1.1)

The premise is that the human player will manage the French national 
railroad with the objective of preserving the state.  Personal wealth
is not a factor.  The scenario begins halfway through World War I.

I've tried to inject a sense of history into this scenario.
Players can predict most major events (Armistice, Great Depression,
rise of Nazi Germany, etc.) but they might not realize the impact of
some of history's footnotes.  I've also taken some liberty with the
scope.  French railroads probably wouldn't have single-handedly beaten
Germany in 1940, but I think it gives a greater sense of purpose.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  This scenario must be played using the full
financial model.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
===================
The human player achieve one of the following before 1941 or the
Nazi invasion of France in 1940.
     Gold - Invest $10,000,000 in industry AND prevent the Nazi
            invasion of France.
     Silver - Invest $10,000,000 in industry.
     Bronze - Invest $5,000,000 in industry.


Halting the Invasion:
=====================
Winning the gold medal means averting the Nazi invasion of France
in 1940.  This is accomplished by accumulating "Bonus Points".  Four
points are awarded in 1920, and the remainder are earned by
completing certain tasks.

Bonus point totals determine the actual month of invasion.  If a 
player accumulates 7 bonus points, then the invasion will occur
during the 8th month (August) of 1940.  If 12 or more bonus points
are earned AND $10,000,000 is invested, then the invasion is averted.
If 12 or more points are earned but less than $10,000,000 is invested,
then the invasion will occur at the end of 1940.

Points are earned as follows:
	4 pts	Awarded automatically in March 1920.

	1 pt	Awarded when Strasbourg is connected.
	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Alsace-Lorraine in 1925.
	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Alsace-Lorraine in 1926.
	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Alsace-Lorraine in 1927.
	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Alsace-Lorraine in 1928.
	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Alsace-Lorraine in 1929.

	If bonus point total is 5 or higher in June 1934, then access will
	be given to Luxembourg and the following bonuses become available.

	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Luxembourg in 1935.
	1 pt	If 12+ carloads are delivered to Luxembourg in 1936.

	If bonus point total is 6 or higher in April 1937, then access will
	be given to Belgium.  No bonuses apply.

	2 pts	If company hauls most carloads in 1939.
	2 pts	If company has highest book value at the end of 1939.
	1 pt	If company has most track cells at the end of 1939.

Beginning in 1920, bonus point totals are announced each February.


MAP CHANGES:
============
This scenario uses a modified version of the Western Europe map 
which is included in the game.  Some of the borders have been
modified to conform with conditions as at 1916.

Several new sub-regions were created to reflect the changing
borders during this time.  Alsace-Lorraine was permanently granted to
France after World War I.  This region has a colourful history of
flip-flopping between France and Germany.

The actual Saar Valley region was about the size of Luxembourg.
However, I've expanded this region to include everything west of the
Rhine River.  This provides a greater chance that a valuable commodity
will be found within it.

Flanders is meant to represent the main WWI battle area.  The name
was chosen because of the poem "In Flanders Fields" (written by a
Canadian officer) which evokes such powerful images of the war.

Poland represents post-WWI boundaries, with some simplifications, and
Russia is completely ignored.  Austria-Hungary is left as one big 
territory, even though it was partitioned via the Treaty of Versailles.  
These regions never come into play anyways.

The city of Clermont-Ferrand in central France is where the Michelin
company arose.  Hence, tire factories should be found here.  Strasbourg 
has been upsized to facilitate certain missions.


NOTES:
======
Players may not terminate their companies and they may not acquire
new territory, except as dictated by pre-set events.

The human player begins with $2,500,000 in cash to build a railroad.
This is meant to give players the flexibility to quickly emulate 
50 years of railroad building in the blink of an eye.


Tips:
=====
* Remember to invest wisely in industry early on.  Don't expect to
  spend $10 million during 1939.
* Don't build to the existing station in Strasbourg.  Build a new
  terminal next to it.
* Strasbourg and Luxembourg will ask for troops and armaments, but
  you will receive credit for any cargos delivered.  Plan ahead
  so that you get the most bonus points.
* Don't get hung up on bonus points.  Your railroad must be
  profitable enough to have cash to invest.  You can't prevent the
  Nazi invasion unless you've invested $10 million.
* Automobiles are fun to build, and the game is biased towards
  auto plants, steel mills, and tire factories.  Rubber is available
  at any port . . . but there aren't many of these.
* If you're having trouble on HARD, consider adjusting the revenue
  modifiers in the difficulty settings when you first start the
  scenario.

Release Notes:
1.1	Fixed most of the runaway bugs, which let the game
	continue beyond 1941.

transcontinental link before the Americans and the British take over
Canada.
