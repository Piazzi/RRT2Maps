Overview:
This map of Switzerland features lots of lakes, rivers, hills and mountains, but also a fair amount of plains. The land is rich in ore, wood, cattle, sheep and milk, among other scattered industries.

Special Features:
- Low cost on electric engines.
- Has to be connected to own tracks.
- Buyable rights to foreign territories.
- Regions with different types of random industries. 

Notes:
I have not added any AI players or win/lose conditions to the map at this time. The human player starts with a company named CFF (which stands for "Chemins de Fer Federaux" in French -- the Swiss railroad company's name). Feel free to tweak the map's options in the editor, because I mostly concentrated on making a very nice-looking (I hope) and diversified map. Elevations were done by hand, so they're not 100% accurate.

Feel free to email me if you have any suggestions/comments.

Enjoy! :)
