PIEMONTE & VALLE D'AOSTA

Map for RT2 classic (and for TSC of course)

Alesso - Udine - Italy - March 2000

The fourth map about Italian regions is ready now: it represents Piemonte and Valle d'Aosta, 
two regions in the North-West of Italy. 

Piemonte is the region where the unification of Italy began in the
second half of the last century; in the chief town, Torino, there are the famous factories 
of FIAT; in Vercelli's province there are lots of rice fields, while Monferrato hills are 
rich of vineyards.

Valle d'Aosta is a small montainous regions where people talk a dialect similar to French; 
it is famous for the presence of the highest mountain in Europe: Monte Bianco (almost 5000 meters high).

As in the other maps of Italian regions there's no scenario: you may play starting in the 
year you want, with the number of competitors you desire, with RT2 classic or with the new engines and 
the new game strategies of TSC,...

Enjoy this map, enjoy Italy!

Have fun,

P.S. As in all the maps I made all the industries and resources are based on real economic
data.
