Build a railroad-system in Hungary. It is an open end game with a lot of of newspapers from 1846 - 2000. 
Notice, that a lot of cities has old names (different from modern names).


Like in all my maps, industries and woods are on the right place. Surely, not all industries worked on 
the same times Ð but I mean, that is no problem for a game!


The game is in German language.
