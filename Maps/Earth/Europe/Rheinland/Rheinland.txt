The 'Rheinland' - Map is located around Cologne (Germany) and reflects
no real geographical details because I could not get an elevation
model or a greyscale map which represent this region. So I drew the
hills having some looks at a normal map (and by remembering some of the
geographical essentials - I spent most of my life in the 'Rheinland').
The scenario is based on one of the most famous products from Cologne -
the beer called 'Koelsch' - and on a world-known car-producer, which has
a factory in Cologne. I think it is quite easy to win gold - try it !
