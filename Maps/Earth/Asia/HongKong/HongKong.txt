I just took any map of Hong Kong off the net, polygoned the land with
dark grey, filled in the sea and insignificant islands with black and
imported it to Railroad Tycoon 2. This is my first RT2 since I got the
game in febuary 2000. The mountains, I don't know if they are that
accurate. Oh yeah, I live in Hong Kong, so there. :)
