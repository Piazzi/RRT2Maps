India.map

	Note: this was one of the original campaign maps from
Railroad Tycoon II (campaign pt. 13 - "Croissants or Crumpets", #13cro~1.map)


  Changes:
1)  removed the "CampaignChoice1To3=" and "CampaignDifficulty1To3=" events

2)  removed the "IndustryInvestments" part of the goals... it just wouldn't
	work in a stand-alone unless you have people set up their game
	exactly, in the Custom section.


  Goals (unchanged from campaign):
Bronze - connect Panaji to Pondichery and Delhi by 1890
Silver - Bronze plus connect to Calcutta by 1880
Gold   - Silver plus connect to Kabul, and be the only surviving railroad
