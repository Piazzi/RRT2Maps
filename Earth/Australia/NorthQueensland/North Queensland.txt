Far North Queensland v0.99 11 Jan 99
------------------------------------
By: Michael Chinn; qamh-michael@powerup.com.au; Brisbane, QLD, Australia

The Idea
--------
This is my first attempt at using the RRT2 editor. At first all I wanted to do was experiment but it ended up being a complete MAP. I actually learnt quite a bit about Queensland's history in planning the map. (like the fact that there was once a plan to form 3 separate states before the turn of the century.)
The scenario is based on the area immediately to the north of Townsville <-> Mt Isa (also known as the Great Northern Line)
I have never been north of Rockhampton so I cannot be certain of many of the landscape details.
Much of the landscape is a rough approximation from the 1 to 1 million Topographic series & some 1960's vegetation maps.

About the area
--------------
Queensland developed separate regional railway systems constructed from ports along the coast to serve inland centres. The Government borrowed on a grand scale to build lines to provide market outlets for mining and agricultural industries and to conquer the vast distances of the sparsely populated outback. This regionalism continues to dominate Queensland politics and its railway heritage movement.
Initially, Queensland Railways (QR) had a 'pony railway' character with humble locomotives, swaying rolling stock, slow trains and unique railway architecture. From the late 1950s, however, exploitation of coal and mineral resources brought prosperity to Queensland and the railways entered into an era of rapid technological and social change. Diesel electric and, later, electric traction, improved rolling stock, upgraded track and modern signalling and communication systems all contributed to the emergence of the QR as Australia's major railway system in terms of size, tonnages carried and technological development.

Inconsistencies
---------------
*In reality the region is much less heavily populated than in the scenario.

*Mt Isa and the Barkley Tablelands don't have any oil, iron or even coal, but the actual minerals aren't included in RRT2 (copper, tin, gold and silver) so you'll have to use your imagination!

*Weipa and much of the west of Cape York has an unusually large amount of Bauxite (which also extends beneath the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Northern Territory)
The alumina smelter for Weipa bauxite is actually located at Gladstone, the aluminium smelter (its a 2 stage process) is located just south at Boyne Island. The bauxite is transported by ship. 
In 1990 11.4 million tonnes of the stuff were produced.

Many of the other industries couldn't be included.
*Pearl fishing - Eastern Cape
*Fishing - Cooktown south
*Tourism (The GBR, Daintree, Cairns etc...)
*Minerals - Gold, Tin, Copper, Lead, Silver
*Breweries & Rum Distilleries

Events
------
Events occur mostly during the first 25 years, but I have included some more in the 1960's and after 1990.
I didn't include many of the droughts, floods, Plagues & pests or cyclones as there were as I wasn't to sure how many the game could handle. (all up there were around 40 events over the past 100 years, I made about 6)
Nothing fancy yet just 'Gameyear=' events.

Restrictions
------------
Mainly a limitation on the types of loco's. I tried to match them to what QR has as best I could.
I also turned OFF quite a few industries.

MAP History, Technical stuff & Future Plans
-------------------------------------------
v0.99 - 1st release of my first map, comments very much appreciated.

I used GIMP to edit the base map (a Linux package) then imported it into RRT2.
All up I spent about 4 days, most of it trial and error in getting the industries to balance on the map.
*However I still couldn't get the logging camps to be generated by the map. I anyone knows why please tell me.
I thought of making this into a campaign (bauxite transport) but am already working on another scenario in more familiar territory.

END MAP STUFF, BEGIN BLABBERING


Wish list & Ideas for more features
-----------------------------------
I know that a lot of these features aren't possible until RRT3 but I thought I'd but in my 2 cents worth.
*Loco's
Including Beyer Garratt 4-8-2 + 2-8-4 (it opened up much of the first heavy mineral hauls in Australia & Africa and saw much more of the planet than the Bigboy 4-8-8-4's did).
The British EMUs and DMUs of the 1950s (0 turn around time but only 2 or 3 passenger cars.  Maybe even more EMUs that get longer over time peaking with the Thalsys at 6 cars.
*the ability to name trains
*Other carriages & industries: 
     Gold in Baggage cars
     Sleeping cars (after 1950) - increase revenue over long distances
     Fertiliser produced by larger cities (see City Dialogs below)
     Tourist generators - National Parks, Special Scenic Elements (esp. Later in the Game)
     Brewery - Grain + Sugar = Beer - Accepted by saloons & city, can be refrigerated
*Station Dialog
     Telephone -> Telegraph -> Electric Staff (1920's?) -> Central Traffic Control (1960's) -> Automatic Train Control? (2005)
     Depot->Medium->Large -> Transit Centre (1970's expands area and integrates with a local transit system for metropolis size and above cities)
     Saloon -> Public Bar
*City Dialogs
A dialog for city development in the later part of the game. Along the lines of a station building screen but for metropolis size and above. Things like a selection of investment in various transit systems (tram, underground/train, bus, light rail, PRT (2010)). This could affect a number of other company features, most notably the economy.
Also the generation of other industries - banks (for Gold), sewage treatment for fertiliser
Construction of other non-station rail services like marshalling yards
*Scenery enhancements
Red dirt (most land around bauxite is red anyway), Rocky desert (costs as much as tundra to build), Special elements - Mesa's (as in 'the side of' so you can build them out of raised squares), Extended bridges (just in editor) like the Forth Bridge or Sydney Harbour bridge, 
Tourism Elements - Waterfalls, caves, gorges, mesas, beaches, resorts
Iced lakes/rivers for tundra scenes.
Additions to trees: Ant Hills and Flowers & Meadows
