The accompanying Cairns-Hinterland.MAP file is an artistic reconstruction 
(from local memory and knowledge of these lines and terrains) of the 
infamous Kuranda Railway which is on the itinerary of nearly every 
tourist who comes to that region.

This map has been constructed so that you can only get inland 
by going up the Kuranda Range from Redlynch to Kuranda to Biboorah to Mareeba.

In this scene, there are certain places that you can only get across the river systems 
because of the way the rivers are constructed.

This is one of the challenges. Don't get frustrated but take things easily 
and test, test, test those gradings.

Also you should be able to construct the inland line from Redlynch 
without using a grade over 4.0 . If you grade colour indicator 
goes into the red, you know you are not on the intended rail routing.

I would suggest that the coastal system be developed first, 
as you will need some huge funds to construct this system to Mareeba and beyond.

Enjoy!
