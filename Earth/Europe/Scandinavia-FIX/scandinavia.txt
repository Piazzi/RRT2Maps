Railroad Tycoon II - "Scandinavia"


1) fixed Gold - briefing states 100 loads, gold trigger was set for 80 loads
	added Message to this as well



	Thanks to Magnus Adielsson for pointing this out



   To use this fixed scenario map, simply copy it into your maps directory
("\Railroad Tycoon II\maps") on your hard drive, overwriting the map which
came with the game.  The filename is exactly the same, and your game should
have no problems recognizing it.
   I have play-tested this map as part of the campaign, and it seems to run
fine, no problems or errors.
   Only those problems mentioned were fixed - nothing else has been done to
the map; all territories, cities, and conditions are exactly as they are in
the map that came with the game.
