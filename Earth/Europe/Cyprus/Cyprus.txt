Railroad Tycoon 2 - 2nd, Century Map of Cyprus

Hello , 
This is my first Job of Map-Making (Design) for my Favorite Game RT2 - TSC .

Cyprus , the Shared Island in the Southest Nediteranean . 

Since 1974 is the Northern Part of Cyprus Occupied by the Turkish Army till today .

So , 25 Years ago after the Turkish Invasion , ( Attilas ) , i have Designed the Cyprus-Map
 the Divided Island . 

For Any Coment please Contact me under my E-Mail Adress: Dimitrios.Christopoulos@T-Online.De

This Scenario is Very Easy: You Start on Year 1974 after the Turkish Invasion .
The Island is Divided by the Greeks in the South and the Turks in The North .
You have Full Rights in the Greek-Cypriot Part , but not in the Northern Turkish-Cypriot Part.
After the Invasion have U.K establish two Military-Bases in Cyprus , in the Greek Part of the Island .
You must buy the Teritory Rights to connect Derinia and Paralimni to the Rest of the Greek-Cyprus Part .

To Connect the Turkish-Part and the Greek-Part of the Island you must Buy the Rights for the Northern part !!!

My Next Work: Maybe .... a Greek or Balkan Map for RT2-TSC ..... or a Update for my Cyprus-Map ?!

So , Enjoy my Map .... Bye .....

Regards , Dimitri Christopoulos

( I have Invested Six Hours Work for my Cyprus-Map . )
