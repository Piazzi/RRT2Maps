---Melting Pit 1.0---by Hoddel
A world drowned, struggeling to keep up civilization. But 
industry still works and lucky me that i don´t have to manage
any tax models with this game.

This is my first map, based on the original middle-europe map
coming with the game.

I tested it several times and it seems to be o.k.
It´s only single player, since i don´t felt like tinkering
for weeks on my first try. If the goal is too high, or something
like that, feel free to alter things as you see fit.
