"SPQR_tsc.mp2"

Adapted for TSC from the original RT2 map "SPQR.map".

Original "SPQR" map from RT2 done by Steve Lorenz

Changes:

1) Frequency - set to "Monthly (Beginning)" instead of "Scenario"

2) checked capitalization on triggers

3) changed name on "Zauces" territory to "Carthage"

4) trigger - checked button for "Single Player"

Note that these changes are necessary to run this type of map (letting the
player choose which country to start in) in TSC... it runs fine as originally
set up in RT2.


Everything else is unchanged from the original.

Thanks to Ronald Albrecht for pointing out the problems running this one in TSC.
