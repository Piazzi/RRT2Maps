"Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century"

Scenario "eastern europe.mp2" (Eastern Europe) - fixes


1) un-disabled Tire Factory (and discovered there were already
	several cities set up to have one)

2) set for default European engines

3) fixed computer starting cash (supposed to be +70K for all computer
	opponents, was set for multiplayer only)

4) undisabled Nuclear Plants, Uranium Mines, and Landfills, made sure
	they were set up in the various regions and cities

5) fixed various reserve cells




   To use this fixed scenario map, simply copy it into your maps directory
("\Railroad Tycoon II - TSC\maps") on your hard drive, overwriting the map which
came with the game.  The filename is exactly the same, and your game should
have no problems recognizing it. In order to use this updated map, you'll
have to start it all over again - any save game of this map will not be fixed
by this update.
   I have play-tested this map, and it seems to run fine, no problems or errors.
   Only those problems mentioned were fixed - nothing else has been done to
the map; all territories, cities, and conditions are exactly as they are in
the map that came with the game.
