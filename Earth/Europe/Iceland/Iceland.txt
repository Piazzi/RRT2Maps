Comments:	This map has been created from a real image of 
		Iceland. Rivers, snow areas and grasslands have
		been placed by myself trying to respect reality.
		No city names have been invented. I have edited
		victory conditions and events to give some spice
		to the game.
		If you encounter any problems during your
		game, don't hesitate to mail me, thanx :)


Copyright:	You are only allowed to reedit this map if you send
		me a mail with a copy of the modified map. You are 
		allowed to distribute this map as you wish, as long 
		as it's in a non-commercial context.

I hope you'll enjoy the game :)
