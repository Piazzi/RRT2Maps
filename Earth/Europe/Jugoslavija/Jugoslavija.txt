Jugoslavija is the first map I ever made. It is based on the railway development in Western Balkans from 1845 to WWI. 
I´ve not found many info about this, so most events are fictitious. All the message texts are written in Spanish. 
This scenario must be played using the full financial model.

freely in return of certain tasks done on time. These rights will be offered to you along the time, as follows:

all the remaining offers.
