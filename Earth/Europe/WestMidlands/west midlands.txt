West Midlands county,England.

This map is based very loosely on the West Midlands in England.It is by no means
meant to be an accurate representation.It is purely meant to be a fun map.
The industries etc. are based pretty much on the real thing.It is also set up as a one player game with very safe trains but of course you are free to change the settings to how you would like them......Have fun,Tigger.

I would be interested in any comments....Neil@Cherylonia.freeserve.co.uk
