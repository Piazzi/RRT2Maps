"Bremen Streetcars" - a map for Railroad Tycoon II - The Second Century
By Lars Maischak, lama@zedat.fu-berlin.de


General:
The aim in this map is to build a streetcar network in the city of Bremen, Germany, at the beginning of the 20th century. The map represents the geography of that place more or less acurately.

Restrictions:
This is a metra-map.
From the beginning, only electrical engines will be available.
Track has to be connected to one's own line.

Players:
Single player + 2 computer players; or
up to 3 players in multiplayer-mode.

Timeframe:
1900 - end of 1920


Victory conditions:
Single player:
BRONZE:	Build a line and transport 200 loads into Downtown.
SILVER: Also connect the airport and the suburb of Horn.
GOLD:	Also connect the suburbs of Gröpelingen and Sebaldsbrück.

Mutiplayer:
GOLD:	Connect one of the suburbs Horn, Gröpelingen, or Sebaldsbrück, or the airport, with Downtown, and transport 20 loads between one of the above territories and Downtown.
If no player reaches this aim by the end of 1920, the player whose company has transported the most loads will get SILVER.

Territories:
In SP and MP games, you will get access to Downtown only once your company has hauled 200 loads. In MP, access to Downtown then can be bought; in an SP game, it will be free.
Access rights to all other territories have to be bought.

Remarks on the history of streetcars in Bremen:
The Senate (i.e. the State Government) of the Free and Hanseatic Town of Bremen was initially opposed to building a streetcar line Downtown. They feared that the mediaeval city-scape would be disfigured by the intrusion of modernity in the guise of overhead wire.
This conservative notion was especially odd since on the other hand, Bremen had been the site of a world exhibition in 1890, where a prototype streetcar line had been operated between the main railway station and the commons.
