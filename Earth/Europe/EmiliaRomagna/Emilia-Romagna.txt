EMILIA-ROMAGNA

by Marco Stefanutti & Alex Cucchiaro (stefanutti@dgt.uniud.it)

Map for RT2 classic (and for TSC of course)

Alesso - Udine - Italy - April 2000

The sixth map about Italian regions is ready now: it represents Emilia-Romagna, 
a region in the North of Italy.

Emilia is the land of Parmigiano cheese and of Parma ham. 
Romagna is full of very crowded beaches.

As in the other maps of Italian regions there's no scenario: you may play starting in the 
year you want, with the number of competitors you desire, with RT2 classic or with the new engines and 
the new game strategies of TSC,...

Enjoy this map, enjoy Italy!

Have fun,

P.S. As in all the maps I made all the industries and resources are based on real economic
data.
