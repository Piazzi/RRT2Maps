United Kingon and Eire Map for Railroad Tycoon II

This is my first attempt at a map for Railroad Tycoon II,
and whilst it has been a fair bit of work I have enjoyed
creating and testing this map.

This map is probably best used as a multi-player map as
the computer players do not seem to get the hang of buying
access rights to allow them to build railways to the big
cities.


Let me know how you get on, and if anyone wants to change
the terrain (hills and mountains), or possibly alter the
rivers, to make them that little bit more correct for the
geography of the two islands let me know.
