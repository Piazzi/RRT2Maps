LIGURIA

Map for RT2 classic (and for TSC of course)

Alesso - Udine - Italy - April 2000

The fifth map about Italian regions is ready now: it represents Liguria, 
a region in the North West of Italy.

Liguria is a stripe of hills along Ligurian Sea. There are lots of ports, touristic centres,
while flowers are cultivated on the hills.

As in the other maps of Italian regions there's no scenario: you may play starting in the 
year you want, with the number of competitors you desire, with RT2 classic or with the new engines and 
the new game strategies of TSC,...

Enjoy this map, enjoy Italy!

Have fun,

P.S. As in all the maps I made all the industries and resources are based on real economic
data.
