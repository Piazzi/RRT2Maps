
Thank you for using this Railroad Tycoon II map.


Installation:

Unzip this zip-file in the dirctory MAPS in your Railroad Tycoon2 Directory 
( f.e. C:\railroad tycoon2\maps)
Now start RRT2 and load this scenario.


	This map is about Iberia (Portugal and Spain), it alsos includes a little bit of France.
	I tried to make it as real as possible.
	You can only start in 1848, date of the first train in Spain.
	You can only build in Portugal in 1856, date of the first train in Portugal.
	
	The map events refer to the most important moments in the history of this countries and Europe. I tried to
reproduce their impact in the economy.

	I'm testing the map and already corrected some things, but I still haven't passed 1870.

	Hope you enjoy it!
