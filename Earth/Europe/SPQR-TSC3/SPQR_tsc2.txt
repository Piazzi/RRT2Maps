"SPQR_tsc2.mp2"

Adapted by Richard Lally from "SPQR_tsc.mp2" to take advantage of TSC features.

Changes:

1) added Status information on all victory factors
2) added SP Briefing 
3) simplified event triggers by utilising the additional features in TSC
4) added Barracks (after 1900) as troop movements would undoubtedly be a feature of a Roman Railroad
5) added Alcohol (for the troops!)
6) added Rubber because Tires and Autos cannot be made without them
7) changed rivers into sea at Gibralta, Sicily and Byzantium (because of the 'sea bridges' in TSC)
8) corrected some spellings e.g. "Gual"


Adapted by David Masters for TSC from the original RT2 map "SPQR.map".

Changes:

1) Frequency - set to "Monthly (Beginning)" instead of "Scenario"

2) checked capitalization on triggers

3) changed name on "Zauces" territory to "Carthage"

4) trigger - checked button for "Single Player"

Note that these changes are necessary to run this type of map (letting the
player choose which country to start in) in TSC... it runs fine as originally
set up in RT2.

Everything else is unchanged from the original.

Thanks to Ronald Albrecht for pointing out the problems running this one in TSC.
