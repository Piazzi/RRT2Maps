LOMBARDIA

by Marco Stefanutti (stefanutti@dgt.uniud.it)

Map for RT2 classic (and for TSC of course)

Alesso - Udine - Italy - February 2000

The third map about Italian regions is ready now: it represents Lombardia, the most "european"
region in Italy. Milano is a metropolis of about 2 million inhabitants and it is surrounded by many 
factories. There are lots of railways in Lombardia. I have placed the most important cities, towns and 
other villages where there are important railway junctions.
As in Veneto & Trentino-Alto Adige map there's no scenario in this map: you may play starting in the 
year you want, with the number of competitors you desire, with RT2 classic or with the new engines and 
the new game strategies of TSC,...

Enjoy this map, enjoy Italy!

Have fun,

P.S. As in all the maps I made all the industries and resources are based on real economic
data.
