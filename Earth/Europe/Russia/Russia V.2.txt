"Russia", v.2

	This is map from the original campaign (part 12,
"When Walls Come Down"), saved as a stand-alone scenario
 -- he's cleaned it up a bit, and added a few more industries
and cities, but essentially it's the same map, with most of
the same goals.

	I fixed the river at Istanbul, but that's all I've
done to it.

	It's a fairly easy-to-play map, in the modern world.
