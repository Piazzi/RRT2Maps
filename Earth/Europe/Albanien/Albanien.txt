Feel free to build a railroad-system in Albanien. It is an open end game. Notice, 
that a lot of cities has old names (very different from modern names).

Like in all my maps, industries and woods are on the right place. Surely, not all industries worked on the 
same times Ð but I mean, that is no problem for a game!
