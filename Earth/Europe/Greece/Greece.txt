Feel free to build a railroad-system in Greece. It is an open end game with historic informations. Notice, 
that the most cities has old names (very different from modern names).
The Newsletters are in German/English language (mixed).

Like in all my maps, industries and woods are on the right place. Surely, not all industries worked on the 
same times Ð but I mean, that is no problem for a game!
