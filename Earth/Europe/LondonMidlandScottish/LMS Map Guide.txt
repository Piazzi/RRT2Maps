   --- Extra Information ---
   Known Bugs : Occasionally a train gets screwed. This is the big game
                bug, where the tender appears before the engine, & it 
                nevers earns any money. Solution is to retire it, & 
                purchase a replacement.
                Lifetime book figures are inaccurate, due to my 
                inexperience in scenario creation. Not a problem.
  Other Notes : Must be played with RRT2-TSC CD.
                I have also done a separate LMS Readme.
