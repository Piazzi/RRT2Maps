                        Real scandinavia

This is my attempt to make scandinavia more realistic, and with more detajls. All major
lakes,rivers and mountains are added. More than 200 towns and cityes are added.
So, in this map its a possiblity to have as much opponemenst as you want.
The industri has been created allmost as it is in the real life.

The big challenge its to make a railroadtrack over the mountains in 
the southern part of Norway, as it is in real life. Its many big mountains
to cross, so its not gonna be easy. The real track goes from Oslo-Finse
(highest station in the northern part of europe)-Bergen.

Installation:

Unzipp the this zip-file into your dirctory MAPS in your Railroad Tycoon2 Directory .
Exs: C:\railroadII\maps
Now you can start rairoad2, and load the scenary.

I hope you will enjoy it,and don't forget to vote on it!!
