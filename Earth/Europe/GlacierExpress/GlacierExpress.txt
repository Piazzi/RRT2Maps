This is a single-player scenario about Swiss railways.
You will have to build up the whole Swiss railway network, but the St. Gotthard line
(from Basel over the St. Gotthard Pass to Chiasso) and the Glacier Express line
(from Zermatt, the Matterhorn town) over the Furka and the Albula Pass to St. Moritz
(the famous resort in the Engadin valley) will have an especially high priority to win the
scenario.
The map uses the maximum size and is made after accurate GIS data of Switzerland;
it includes all major towns, lakes and mountains; industries are put together as
near to reality as possible.
