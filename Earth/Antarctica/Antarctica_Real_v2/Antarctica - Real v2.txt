v2.0 fixes:
Bringing this from testing to distribution I forgot to reset the following variables:
>Players will now lose if their Player Net Worth dips below $10,000, instead of $100,000.
>Players may now change the competition.



This is an accurate map of Antarctica today.  All of the Topology, Geography, Elevations, Seas, Oceans, Research Stations, Ice Flows, and Dimensions are perfectly represented as they are in real life.  The Towns and Cities are based on the size of the actual Research Stations.  Pick up a Research Map of Antarctica, and you'll find everything in my RR2 map.

To win the Gold, you need a Player Net Worth of $1 Billion & a Company Book Value of $1 Billion.  This may sound difficult, but if you start before 1850, it's quite attainable.

This scenario depicts current day Antacrica in 1825 with the actual research stations already in place.

			**Beware**

The RR2 Maps are very intelligent and base the density/existence of housing, industry, and resources partly on the terrain.  Because of this, inland Antarctica will be very sparse.  This map is exactly the same as my map "Antacrtica - Ozone Effect", but without the grass.  This makes a huge difference.  Play both and see!  Just as in real life, you would not build too much in the middle of a giant sheet of ice.  The artificial intelligence takes this into account.

Watch for the robbers, they're very unique!

Check your competition.  If it is too difficult, change them to easier characters, or have less.

Play at Expert Level!  You won't have as much fun if you don't!  There are lots of triggers, all very realistic.  Watch for them!

To install:
Copy the .MAP file to your \Railroad Tycoon II\Maps dirctory.

FYI:  Over 70 hours went into the making of this map.
