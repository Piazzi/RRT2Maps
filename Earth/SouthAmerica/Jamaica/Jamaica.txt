This one is from an image. After a painful cleaning of the un-usable
details such as gas stations, it was resampled. blurred and converted to gray-scale
in Adobe Photoshop 5. 
This is a beta version. Events were added in haste - any tips on
the use of event editor would be appreciated.It contains about 40 to 45 towns and bigger villages,
and all remarkable physical features of Jamaica, such as The Cockpit Country, 
Blue Mountains, Black River, etc.
