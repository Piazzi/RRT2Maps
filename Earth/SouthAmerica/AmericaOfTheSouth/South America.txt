They have been modified some courses of the rivers to adjust them to the reality, especially the existing in Argentina , Paraguay and Uruguay. They have been drawn some but. Also it has been made what is own in the birth of the affluent of the Amazon as the Black river. Equally it has been made with the Orinoco. They have been put the names of the rivers, dams and lakes.

What but real of this stage are 55 news that they have been taken of the encyclopedias and happened and that nearly all have its influence on the economy of the game. Even the of the year 2.001, in which it will be my 50 anniversary, I hope that both events are fulfilled.
