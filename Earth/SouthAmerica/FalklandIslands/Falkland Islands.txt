Other Notes : I have found a Falkland Islands map on the Net.
I have put levels of grey according to the altitudes
then made a .PCX file before to import it inside the map editor
and adapt it by hand to be more realistic and enhanced.
During 1982 War on Port-Stanley, I hear BBC radio to know more
about this war, because in France where I lived, media TV were not
so developed like today.
Major ports will send wool and farmers have sheeps and cows.
When the territory will be kept by Argentina on 1982 April 2nd,
each player will pay $1,000,000 to survive. This money will be back
plus 50% after date June 15th when UK troopers will win the Port-
Stanley battle.
In 1995, the announcement of oil fields discovered north of Falkland
Islands area has been done. Reality or virtuality ? In my game, the
reality has been chosen and oil production will increase.
Have a funny game and send me comments to my Email address above.
