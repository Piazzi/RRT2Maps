"Railroad Tycoon 2: The Second Century"

Scenario "Africa After the Flood.mp2" - fixes


1) starting year problem - most of the engines are disabled via the
	Map Options, so any starting year earlier than 1910 meant
	you wouldn't have an engine available for a number of years.
	Fixed starting date.




   To use this fixed scenario map, simply copy it into your maps directory
("\Railroad Tycoon II - TSC\maps") on your hard drive, overwriting the map which
came with the game.  The filename is exactly the same, and your game should
have no problems recognizing it.
   I have play-tested this map as part of the campaign, and it seems to run
fine, no problems or errors.
   Only those problems mentioned were fixed - nothing else has been done to
the map; all territories, cities, and conditions (with the exception of Chicago)
are exactly as they are in the map that came with the game.
