Great Northern
Scenario Map for Railroad Tycoon II TSC.
version 3.0

In 1878 between the eastern most cities of United States and Canada and those of the
Pacific Coast existed a vast undeveloped and untamed land.  This was the place they
meant when they said "Go west young man." 

Several railroads conquered this land, none was greater than the Great Northern.  
The Great Northern was founded by James Hill, known and remembered as "The Empire Builder." 
Throughout his years of creating, encouraging and directing, Mr. Hill's creed was development of the resources of the region the railway served.
