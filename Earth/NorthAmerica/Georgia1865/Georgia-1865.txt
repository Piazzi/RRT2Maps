This is a moderate-sized map, original image from NOAA.  It covers Georgia and parts of surrounding states.

It must begin in 1865; one AI opponent is required, two are the maximum.

The N.A. managers are allowed.  Most industry is allowed, except coffee farms and nuclear power plants.

There are no general restrictions, except that you must lay track connected to your existing track.

The bronze requires $30MM company book value by 1905.  
Silver is a $30MM player net worth by 1905.
Gold is having both.

I've put in all of the notable towns in Georgia on the map, but have not verified that they did exist in 1865.  Of particular interest to me was putting in the lakes and rivers; Georgia-Florida-Alabama are currently in a "water war", so seeing where those rivers are was a good lesson for me.

Two of my grandparents worked for Georgia railroads, by the way.
