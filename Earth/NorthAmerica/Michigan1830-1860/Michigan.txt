This map was inspired by Pete C.'s Minnesota map, but taken to the extreme.  It is only a beta version and I would like some feedback on likes/dislikes.  If feedback is positive, I may convert it to a RT3 map.  It starts out slow, but really takes off after 10 - 15 years.  Please send comments to:

Thanks for trying it out.
