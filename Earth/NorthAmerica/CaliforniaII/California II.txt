The California II Map for Railroad Tycoon - TSC.
version 2.0
The Golden State welcomes your railroad.
See if you can win the golden medal.
Beware though there is an earthquake event that can
destroy trains, tracks and stations.
Also the historic 1905 flood that created the Salton Sea
may also happen.  

The actual ground scale is about 3 miles per
cell. (not the 10 as in RRT2)
To relate on a smaller scale things like 
track building, maintenance are decreased 
by 50%. 

ver. 1
  .1 Added ecomonic downturn after quake
  .2 Long Beach fixed.  Corrected spelling
  .3 researched a little more.
      also no customs between states.
  .4 The Gold and Silver were a little too high.
      Lowered them.
  .5 New References result in small changes in
      resource locations.
2.0 Califorina has it all floods, earthquakes, fires.
    Well no fires but floods and earthquakes in this new
    TSC version.
