Prince of Steel II
Map for Railroad Tycoon II - TSC.
version 2.0

The ultimate industrial strength TSC map.
The period of America where steel is king.
Starting Prince of Steel map is fairly easy. Everyone makes
money hauling passengers.  But sooner or later this doesn't
pay as well as it used to.   Use this early money to build
rails to resources.  Resources are located realistically and
may be far away from your starting location.
Train speeds are increased (and revenue reduced) so you can 
reach these locations within a lifetime.

1.1  Coal Strike chance increased
1.2  Added Ports to Great Lake cities, Size of territories slightly increased, 
     meat packing added to several cities.
1.3  Changed some of Lake Erie coastline and moved some great lake cities
     a cell or two so ports can grow.
1.4  Adjusted border of Chicago.  Added Iron mine at Erie.  This because there
     was a great deal of iron shipped into the port at Erie, but the game only
     allows one type of general port.
1.5  Added events so that when computer or human starts a new company after the
     New York relents notice they get free access to all restricted cities.
1.6  Corrected playerid vs companyid mismatch.
1.7  Major change:  
     MP - Each human player receives a free buyin to the following territories 
     depending on the order they form companies.  Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, 
     Canada, New York, .. repeat.
     SP - Human player recieves random free buyin for either Chicago, Philadelphia, 
     Detroit or New York.

2.0  Map re-done with TSC events and industries.
