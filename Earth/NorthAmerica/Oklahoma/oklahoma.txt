I wrote this map as my wife's family is from Oklahoma. Its not hard - I wanted it easy enough for my kids to play. Its based on a number of different maps I have of the state so the geography should be reasonably accurate. It features events like the two Oklahoma Land Runs, Oklahoma becoming a state, the World Fair in St. Louis and the depression of the 1930's.

It can be played on any version of Railroad Tycoon.

Hope you enjoy it.
