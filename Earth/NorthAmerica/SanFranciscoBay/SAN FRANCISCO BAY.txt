Here's my latest map - San Francisco Bay.  It includes all of the San Francisco Bay Area and a large part of Northern California from Monterey to Santa Rosa and from the ocean to the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  The San Joaquin Valley is also included. The map is fairly accurate, although I've taken some liberties with adding and iron ore and coal fields in the foothills and mountains.  I've added some interesting events that, I hope, will make playing this map a little more fun and interesting.  Helpful comments would be welcomed.  E-mail to browntop1@yahoo.com
