Canada.map

	Note: this was one of the original campaign maps from
Railroad Tycoon II ("Crossing the Divide", campaign pt. 6, #06cro~1.map).


  Changes:
1)  removed the "CampaignChoice1To3=" and "CampaignDifficulty1To3=" events

2)  fixed the reserve cells for Toronto - now it's possible to build a
	station there and have it count

3)  connected Newfoundland to the mainland with a river, instead of separating
	it with ocean (what the heck, they put cities on it...)

4)  finished 'painting' the territory of Nova Scotia


  Goals (unchanged from campaign):
Bronze - Halifax to Vancouver, 8 loads between them by 1898
Silver - Halifax to Vancouver, 8 loads between them, $20,000,000 company worth
	by 1898
Gold   - Halifax to Vancouver, 8 loads between them, $50,000,000 company worth
	by 1898
