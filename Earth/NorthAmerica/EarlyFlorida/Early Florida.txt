Other Notes : Based on a relief map. There are two specific bonuses by connecting to Tallahassee and connecting to Key West. Not only does the company but the player benefits as well.
CONNECTING TO KEY WEST: Yes, it is possible. However, it is best to start from the mainland and to remember bridge-laying. It will take at the very least 10 bridges, so do take into account the expense. I have tested the possibility several times, and I have always been able to connect.
