Welcome to Rhode Island.  *** NEW VERSION ***

This map, "Rhode Island v1.5" was created using Adobe Photoshop 5.0
and the full version of Railroad Tycoon II by PopTop Software.

The "Rhode Island v1.5" Map is Copyright 1998 by Scott P. Morin and 
www.ScottSPM.com.  You may use this map and distribute it freely 
as long as this Text File is sent along with it.

The "Rhode Island v1.0" Map was created during the month of November,
1998 and was completed at 7:35am on Sunday, November 29th, 1998.  This
map was modified during the first week of December 1998 and revisions
were completed at 4:59am on 12/06/98.  This map is the final product 
of about 35+ hours of love, sweat, and tears.

** Things new to 1.5:
	- The industry problem relating to cities with ports after 
	1875 has been corrected.
	- About 5% of the cities/towns were removed due to some
	overcrowding.
	- The industry model was modified for about 30% of cities.
	- Some minor graphical problems were fixed.
   - Thanks to everyone who gave me comments/suggestions.

I tried to be as real as I could in creating this...and for the most
part I think I succeeded.  Keep in mind this was my first map and I
changed a few things to make gameplay more practical.  There are no 
events or goals in this map.  It has been designed for those of you, 
like myself, who just love to lay track and have fun!
