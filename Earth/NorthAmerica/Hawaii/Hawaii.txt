Hawaii
Map for Railroad Tycoon II.
version 1.0

This is a fairly simple map of Hawaii.  The key to success is
to employ the ports well.  Various exported goods will bring
in needed freight.  Some of these can be used locally and
re-exported.

At start you have to buy rights from the local government.
In 1898 the US annexes Hawaii and you are permitted to
build anywhere you please.
