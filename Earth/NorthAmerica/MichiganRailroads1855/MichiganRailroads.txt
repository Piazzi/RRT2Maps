MICHIGAN RAILROADS 1855 version 1:

Welcome to Michigan!
The Michigan Peninsula is booming with logs, automobiles and agricultural products.  Are you able to supply the industries 
with the raw materials they need and prosper?
I sugest the player to start with a small railway from Chicago or Detroit. After a few years to consolidate your company, 
you can start building the  trunk line between the two cities via Kalamazoo and Ann Arbour. Chicago and Detroit  are a huge 
urban centers, so there should be plenty of mail and passengers to carry to and from the provinces. By 1920 or so, the whole 
system should be built, and by this time it will take approximately 175 trains to run it. Note:: From 1950 no  steam 
locomotives are avaiable.

PORTS:	IMPORT:				EXPORT:		OTHER DATA: RRT2, The second Century
	 Rubber				 Steel		 option for multiple companies.  Start year 1855.
	 Cotton				 Paper		 Engine avaibility: Typical North American.
	 Aluminium			 Lumber		 Start economy: 90%. Growth: 1,0% per year.
	 Goods: 1 unit per dock.
Win conditions: BRONZE: 50 mill., SILVER: 75 mill., GOLD: 100 mill. of company book value within 45 years.
By  drawing this map I have built all railway lines with a maximum gradient of 2,5%, and replaced them with reserve cells.
When finished the map I have liqudated the company and then tested the game by playing it 2 times.
Personally I prefer to simulate a minor railway system with pretty landscapes, without any disturbing competition or too 
many train crashes. If You agree, I recommend the following cheat: TAB. Then whrite NOWRECK to eleminate all traincrashes.

This map has been drawn by Anders Robert Pilgaard - Århus - Denmark.  (bx03638@post7.teledk).
