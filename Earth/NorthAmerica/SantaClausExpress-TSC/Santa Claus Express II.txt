Railroad Tycoon II - The Second Century

Map Title: Santa Claus Express II
Version: 2.1 (Dec. 22/99)

This map can be played only in TSC and Gold versions of RRT2.

This is a Christmas map that I thought would be fun for the
holidays.  The map is based in Canada only, but where else would
the North Pole be but in Canada? (Magnetic north pole anyway.)
Besides, that's where I live and am familiar with.

The map is based on the Canada map, map 6 in the original RRT2
campaign, with numerous changes to make it closer to the real city
and territory locations.  Also, three railways of Canada, CN, CP and
BC Rail have been placed as close as possible to the actual 
locations as I could within the limits of scale. 

Special notes:  
1. This map also available as original RRT2 version.
2. I made all industries generated by the game to avoid the 
potential oversupply bug (even though I don't seem to get it).  
There may be a very slim chance that you don't get a port at the
North Pole.  If so just restart again.  I would like to know if
this happens so send an email if it does.
3. The AI railroads seem to use a huge amount of resources, so if
the game pauses for a few seconds, be patient, it will come back.

Changes from RRT2 version 1.0:
1. Added more snow (it is December after all).
2. Added requirement for mail delivery.
3. Added status updates.
4. Subsidy trigger checked monthly.
5. Changed date to Dec. 10.

Changes from version 2.0:
1. Fixed silver events for Vancouver and Thunder Bay.
2. Added notes to intro and victory conditions.

All suggestions are welcome.
