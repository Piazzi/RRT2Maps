The LA Metro Map for Railroad Tycoon II - TSC.
version 1.01
The Los Angeles area needs a rapid transit train system.
See if you can develop one for the city.  
While this is a personal wealth game, your company will 
receive bonuses for hauling the most loads. You can make
money yourself for pleasing certain groups that let's just
say will remain nameless.

This is my first metro type map.  As I learn more about them
I will update the map to newer versions.

1.01 Cleaned up some single river cells.  Also added terminals to
     two airports.  The terminals are what demands airport cars not
     the tarmac.
