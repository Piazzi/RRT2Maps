West Virginia is my first map, so I welcome any and all comments.

I'm not from West Virginia, so I make this disclaimer up front - if I've missed your favorite town, or misplaced a river or two, please forgive.

As I was looking for a state to map, I fell in love with West Virginia and the Railroad opportunities and as I researched the railroad history there, it just keep on getting more interesting. I hope everyone enjoys playing this map as much as I have enjoyed making it.

Any comments or advise on improving it should go to gdj@kcinter.net.

Enjoy,
