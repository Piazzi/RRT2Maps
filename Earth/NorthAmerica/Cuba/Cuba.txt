Copy the file CUBA.MAP into your rt2/maps folder

I worked on this map for a few days on a whim and 
ended up being more work than expected. Especially
the trigger formulas. For example, for gold the 
message states one must connect all the cities but
in reality there's no way to check more than a
about 30 connections or so before one runs out of
space. Still, the formula is done cleverly enough
(I hope) that it should produce the desired
effect.

You may find this scenario to be pretty challenging.
Since your own personal wealth is irrelevant per
the goals on this scenario you may want to consider
issuing more stock every year. Running up lots of
bonds, spending the money and then declaring 
bankruptcy should be a good idea too. Lastly, if
you're so inclined, you can always mess around
with the editor yourself or just play at an easier
level.

Anyway, I'm thinking of doing a couple other maps.
My site, www.rasiel.com, should be up soon.
Meanwhile, I'm at http://home.earthlink.net/~rasiel
and email at rasiel@yahoo.com

Happy railroading!
