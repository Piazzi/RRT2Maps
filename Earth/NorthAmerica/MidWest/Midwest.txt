This Map of the midwestern USA is one I spent alot of time with 
to make it very detailed as far as topography, cities, towns, and 
industries.  Still being a newbie at RT2 I will leave it up to you as 
to how you use it.  It is much smaller than Heartland encompassing all 
of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin and just parts of the 
surrounding states including Ontario, Canada.  Please let me know what 
you think.
