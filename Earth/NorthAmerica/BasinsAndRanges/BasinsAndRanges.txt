This map of the southwestern US is just the result of one weekends work.
It's not a full scenario, because there are no events and no goals to
reach. I just thought, it should be interesting, to build up a railway
system, beginning at the pacific coast and aiming to the rockies.
I'm shure, this map can be optimized, enhanced and made more realistic, 
especially concerning the economic settings. Maybe there's somebody out 
there, who would like to do that...

I hope, you'll enjoy this map
