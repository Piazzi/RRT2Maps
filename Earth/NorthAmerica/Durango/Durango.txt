Durango
Map for Railroad Tycoon II TSC.
version 1.2

The Silver Rush is on.   Let your railroad form the backbone
of this industry high in the Rockies.

Single player mode only.  There is not enough normal cargo for
both you and the AIs.   But there are unique and lucrative ways
to earn your fortune. 

Watch out if you try the 'stop your trains trick' to crash company 
stock prices.  High negative company cash and low revenue and not 
hauling loads will in some cases have the right-of-ways in Denver
taken from
