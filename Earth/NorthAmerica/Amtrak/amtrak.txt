This is a TSC map. It is really a single player game, in that the victory conditions are
not very meaningful for more than one player. There are at least 3 pairs of cities that you
can connect at the  beginning and go on to win, so it is reasonably balanced. 
I haven't tested it as a multiplayer map.

I've tried to make this map a challange for a single player, so it is a bit different than
many of the player created maps. I don't think you'll ever run more than 50 trains or find 
your company with more cash than you know what to do with. I've left out many small towns
and cities in order to make the game more difficult.  I also thought it would be interesting
to see how a map works when an AI company clogs up the major cities. I'm afraid the victory
conditions don't always work perfectly, in that the AI is occasionaly pathetic and the Gold
condition (Amtrak goes bankrupt) sometimes happens with no player intervention whatsoever, 
and so is as easy to get as Silver. 

The terrain comes from the USGS 30" Terrain Base. I've tried to make the industries reasonably
accurate, within the limitations of the game. 

This is basically the same map as "B&O 2" which I made ages ago and which still should be 
posted on the UK Railroad Express site. I've cleaned up the terrain a bit and completely 
redone the industries and events.
