New Japan Scenario for RRT2-2nd Century

Feedback is requested regarding playability of this scenario.

I lived in Japan from 92-97. During this time JNR was
privatized. One of the biggest problems the new company faced 
was the inefficiency of its lines. This had been exacerbated over
the years by politicians seeking Shinkansen (Bullet train) lines
in their districts. Massive amounts of government money would
then flow into the region for the construction of the extremely
expensive lines - filling the coffers of contractors who would
then pass on favors to the politician. Since the demand was not 
there to pay for this construction, JNR began to accumulate massive 
amounts of debt.

My thinking behind this scenario is that the player should strive
to maximize the efficiency of the trains. I threw in Mao Zedong as
an example of the competition to JNR by private lines like Hankyu
and Keihan. Due to the limitations of RRT I was unable to faithfully
render this aspect of JNR's problem. However I still found the scenario 
to be enjoyable. I hope you do too.
